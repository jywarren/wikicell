The term has a history of scholarly debate surrounding its precise meaning, but a castle is usually considered to be the \"private fortif\n- ied residence\" of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a fortress, which was not a home, or a fortified town, which was a public defence. Over the extended pe\n- riod of time that castles were built they took on a great many forms with many different features, but some, such as the curtain wall and arrow slits, were comm\n- |-\n onplace.\n Castles originated in the 9th&#160;and 10th&#160;centuries, when the fall of the Carolingian Empire in Europe and the rise of feudal society led to the\n- \" territory of the collapsing empire being divided between individual lords and princes, and an emphasis on personal defence. Castles controlled their immediate \"\n- areas, and were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as protection from an enemy. Although t\n- \"heir military origins are often emphasised, castles also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local \"\n- |-\n populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near elements such as a mill, integral to life in the community.\n Many castles were o\n- riginally built from earth and timber, and had their defences replaced later by stone equivalents. In the late 12th&#160;and early 13th&#160;century, a scientif\n- ic approach to castle defence emerged. Towers proliferated, with an emphasis on flanking fire, and many new castles were polygonal, while previously they had re\n- \"lied more on the lay of the land and were curvilinear, or relied on concentric defence&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 several stages of defence within each other that could all funct\"\n- ion at the same time, thereby maximising the castle\'s firepower. The origin of these changes in defence has been attributed to a mixture of influence from the C\n- \"rusades&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 where castle technology was advanced such as the new type of concentric fortification&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and drawing on earlier defences such as Roman fo\"\n- rts for inspiration. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, and devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defen\n- |-\n ce into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress, and to dominate their landscape.\n Gunpowder, introduced to Europe i\n- n the 14th&#160;century, did not have an immediate impact on castle building. Castles do not show adaptation to resist bombardment by cannons until the 15th&#16\n- \"0;century, when artillery became powerful enough to break down walls. Although castles were built across Europe well into the 16th&#160;century, new techniques \"\n- to deal with improved cannon eventually led to them becoming uncomfortable and undesirable places to live, and so true castles went into decline, replaced by ar\n- tillery forts with no role in administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18th&#160;century onwards, there was a renewed interest in cas\n- |-\n tles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no defensive purpose.\n \n \n \n \n Contents\n \n \n 1 Definition\n \n 1\n- |-\n .1 Etymology\n 1.2 Defining characteristics\n \n \n 2 Common features\n \n 2.1 Motte\n 2.2 Bailey and enceinte\n 2.3 Keep\n 2.4 Curtain wall\n 2.5 Moat\n 2.6 Gatehouse\n 2.7 Other feat\n- |+\n ures\n \n \n 3 History\n \n 3.1 Antecedents\n 3.2 Origins and early castles\n 3.3 Innovation and scientific design\n 3.4 Advent of gunpowder\n 3.5 Later use and revival castles\n \n- |-\n \n 4 Construction\n 5 Social centre\n 6 Castle landscapes\n 7 Warfare\n 8 See also\n 9 References\n 10 Further reading\n 11 External links\n \n \n \n \n \n //<![CDATA[\n if (window.showTocTo\n- |-\n ggle) { var tocShowText = \"show\"; var tocHideText = \"hide\"; showTocToggle(); } \n //]]>\n \n [edit] Definition\n [edit] Etymology\n \n \n \n \n The Norman \"White Tower\", the keep\n- \" of the Tower of London, exemplifies all uses of a castle: city defence, a residence, and a place of refuge in times of crisis.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Castle is derived from the Lat\"\n- \"in word castellum. This is a diminutive of the word castrum, which means \\\"fortified place\\\". The Old English castel, French ch\\xC3\\xA2teau, Spanish castillo, Italian c\"\n- \"astello, as well as other European words for castle derive from castellum.[2] The word castle was introduced into English shortly before the Norman Conquest to \"\n- denote this type of building, then new to England, introduced to the country by Normans working for Edward the Confessor.[3] Although the various terms used for\n- \" castles in Europe derive from the same root, they are not universally applied to the same types of structures. The French ch\\xC3\\xA2teau is used to describe a grand \"\n- \"country house at the heart of an estate, regardless of the presence of fortifications.[4]\\n\\\n [edit] Defining characteristics\\n\\\n In its simplest terms, the definition \"\n- of a castle accepted amongst academics is \"a private fortified residence\".[5] This contrasts with earlier fortifications, such as Anglo Saxon burhs and walled c\n- \"ities such as Constantinople and Antioch in the Middle East: castles were not communal defences but were built and owned by the local feudal lord, either for th\"\n- emselves of for their monarch.[6] In the late 20th&#160;century, there was a trend to refine the definition of a castle by including the criterion of feudal own\n- ership, thus tying castles to the medieval period. However this does not necessarily reflect what medieval people called castles. During the First Crusade (1096\n- \"\\xE2\\x80\\x931099) the Frankish armies encountered walled settlements and forts that they indiscriminately called castles, but would not be considered such under the mode\"\n- |-\n rn definition.[5]\n \n \n \n \n Windsor Castle in England was first built as a fortification of the Norman Conquest, and today is home to Queen Elizabeth II of the United\n- \" Kingdom.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Castles served a range of purposes, the most important of which were military, administrative, and domestic. Early castles were primarily military i\"\n- \"nstitutions, places of protection from an enemy. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which could be used as a base of operations \"\n- in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England as both defensive and offensive tools to pacify the inhabitants.[7] As William the Co\n- nqueror advanced through England after the Norman Conquest in 1066, he fortifed key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087 he establis\n- hed 36&#160;castles such as Warwick Castle, which was used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.[8][9] However, a recent trend to view castles les\n- s as military institutions and more as social structures has questioned the current definition. During the Middle Ages, castles tended to lose their military si\n- |-\n gnificance and became more important as residences and statements of power.[10]\n In Britain the term \"castle\" has also been erroneously used to refer to Iron Age\n- \" fortifications such as Maiden Castle, Dorset.[11] A castle was not only a bastion and prison but also a place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers.\"\n- \" Over time the aesthetics of the design became more important, as the castle\'s appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant. Cast\"\n- les were built as defensive measures and offensive weapons, but comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls. Although castles still prov\n- |-\n ided protection from low levels of violence in later periods, eventually they were succeeded by country houses as high status residences.[12]\n [edit] Common feat\n- \"ures\\n\\\n [edit] Motte\\n\\\n Main article: Motte-and-bailey\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The wooden palisades surmounting mottes were often later replaced in stone, as in this example at Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau \"\n- |-\n de Gisors in France.\n \n \n A motte was a mound with a flat top. The mounds were often artificial, although sometimes they incorporated a pre-existing feature of the\n- \" landscape. The excavation of earth for the mound would leave a ditch around the motte, which acted as a further defence. Sometimes a nearby stream would be div\"\n- erted to flood the ditch, creating a moat. Motte and moat derive from the same Old French word, indicating that they were originally associated features and dep\n- \"ended on each other for their construction. Although the motte is usually associated with the bailey to form a motte-and-bailey castle, this was not always the \"\n- \"case and there are instances where a motte existed on its own. \\\"Motte\\\" refers to the mound alone, but it was often surmounted by a fortified structure, such as \"\n- a keep, and the flat top would be surrounded by a palisade.[13] The motte was accessed by a flying bridge as represented by the Bayeux Tapestry\'s depiction of C\n- \"h\\xC3\\xA2teau de Dinan.[14] Sometimes a motte covered an older castle or hall, whose rooms now became underground storage areas and prisons beneath a new donjon.[15]\\n\"\n- |-\n [edit] Bailey and enceinte\n Main article: Enceinte\n A bailey, also called a ward, was a fortified enclosure. They were a common feature of castles, and most had a\n- t least one. The keep on top of the motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home of t\n- \"he rest of the lord\'s household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities could all be expected to be \"\n- \"found in the bailey. There was a progression for lords to build more comfortable accommodation for themselves within the bailey, which resulted in the creation \"\n- of another bailey that separated the high status buildings such as the lord\'s chambers and the chapel, from the everyday structures such as the workshops and ba\n- rracks.[16] Although often associated with the motte-and-bailey type of castle, baileys could be found as independent defensive structures. These simple fortifi\n- cations were called ringworks.[17] The terms bailey and enceinte are linked, as the enceinte was the castle\'s main defensive enclosure. A castle could have seve\n- ral baileys but only one enceinte. Castles with no keep and which relied on their outer defences for protection are sometimes called enceinte castles;[18] these\n- \" were the earliest form of castles, before the donjon arrived in the 10th century.[19]\\n\\\n [edit] Keep\\n\\\n Main article: Keep\\n\\\n A keep was a great tower and usually the s\"\n- \"trongest point of a castle before the introduction of concentric defence. Keep was not a term used in the medieval period&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the term was applied from the\"\n- \" 16th&#160;century onwards&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and donjon was used to refer to great towers,[20] or turris in Latin. Dungeon is a corrupted form of donjon and means a dark\"\n- \", unwelcoming prison.[21] Although often the strongest part of a castle and a last place of refuge if the outer defences fell, the keep was not left empty in ca\"\n- se of attack but was used as a residence by the lord who owned the castle, or his guests or representatives.[22] Initially this was only the usual pattern in En\n- gland, when after the Norman Conquest of 1066 the \"conquerors lived for a long time in a constant state of alert\"; elsewhere the lord\'s wife presided over a sep\n- \"arate residence (domus, aula or mansio in Latin) close to the keep, and the donjon was a barracks and headquarters. Gradually the two functions merged into the \"\n- same building; for many examples choosing the appropriate term can be difficult, and the highest residential storeys have large windows.[23] In motte-and-bailey\n- \" castles, the keep was on top of the motte.[13]\\n\\\n [edit] Curtain wall\\n\\\n Main article: Curtain wall (fortification)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Carcassonne, France, showing the classic feat\"\n- |-\n ures of the curtain walls, defensive ditch with arched bridge, and cylindrical flanking towers, with a gatehouse and additional wooden defensive structures.\n \n \n C\n- \"urtain walls were defensive walls enclosing a bailey. They had to be high enough to make scaling the walls with ladders difficult and thick enough to withstand \"\n- bombardment from siege engines which from the 15th&#160;century onwards included artillery. A typical wall could be 3&#160;m (9.8&#160;ft) wide and 12&#160;m (3\n- \"9&#160;ft) tall, although sizes varied greatly between castles. To protect them from undermining, curtain walls were sometimes given a stone skirt around their \"\n- base. Walkways along the tops of the curtain walls allowed defenders to rain missiles on enemies from above, and battlements gave them further protection. Curta\n- in walls would be studded with towers to allow enfilading fire along the wall.[24] Arrow slits in the walls did not become common in Europe until the 13th&#160;\n- |-\n century, for fear that they might compromise the wall\'s strength.[25]\n [edit] Moat\n Main article: Moat\n A moat was a defensive ditch with steep sides, and could be\n- \" either water-filled or dry. Its purpose was to stop engines such as siege towers from reaching the curtain wall and to prevent the walls from being undermined.\"\n- \" Water moats are found in low lying areas. Moats were often crossed by a drawbridge, although these were often replaced by stone bridges. The moat around Flint \"\n- \"Castle in Wales needed 1,800&#160;excavators to build. Fortified islands could be added to the moat, adding another layer of defence. Water defences, including \"\n- moats as well as natural lakes, had the benefit of dictating the enemy\'s approach to the castle.[26] The 13th-century Caerphilly Castle, also in Wales, has some\n- \" of the largest water defences in Western Europe, on a site covering over 30&#160;acres (120,000&#160;m2), created by flooding the valley to the south of the ca\"\n- |-\n stle.[27]\n [edit] Gatehouse\n Main article: Gatehouse\n An undeveloped entrance is the weakest part in a circuit of defences. To overcome this, the gatehouse was dev\n- eloped, allowing those inside the castle to control the flow of traffic. In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in\n- \" stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot, so to allow the defenders to see the gate without exposing themselves projecting towers were added on each si\"\n- de of the gate, in a style similar to that developed by the Romans.[28] Contained within the building would be a series of defences to make a direct assault mor\n- \"e difficult than battering down a simple gate. There would be one or more portcullis&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 a wooden grille reinforced with metal to block a passage&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 \"\n- and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry an enemy. The passage through the gatehouse would have been lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant ha\n- \"d to spend being shot at in a confined space.[29] It is a popular myth that so-called murder-holes&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 openings in the roof of the gateway passge&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 \"\n- were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead, and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was completel\n- y impractical. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, similar to machicolations or to pour water to extinguish fires.[30] Provision was made i\n- n the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation, so the gate was never left undefended, although this evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of\n- \" defence.[31] The entrance to a castle could be further elaborated through the addition of a barbican. This consisted of a rampart and ditch in front of the gat\"\n- ehouse.[32] Developed in the 13th and 14th centuries,[33] it could also include a tower. The purpose of a barbican was not just to provide another line of defen\n- |-\n ce but to dictate the only approach to the gate.[34]\n [edit] Other features\n Battlements were most often found surmounting curtain walls, although also on the top\n- s of gatehouses, and comprised several elements; crenellations, hoardings and machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating\n- \" crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks on top of a wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at or\"\n- \" drop objects on attackers at the base of the wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Ma\"\n- chicolations were stone openings in the top of the wall that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base off the wall in a similar fashion to hoarding\n- s.[35] Arrowslits, also commonly called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts to be fired on attack\n- ers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but the size of the opening could also impede the defender if it w\n- \"as too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming.[36]\\n\\\n [edit] History\\n\\\n [edit] Antecedents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Ambleside Roman \"\n- |-\n fort, England\n \n \n Historian Charles Coulson states that the accumulation of wealth and resources such as food in ancient societies led to the need for defensive s\n- \"tructures. The earliest fortifications originate from the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. \"\n- \"Northern Europe was slower than the east to develop defensive structures and it was not until the Bronze Age that hill forts were developed, which proliferated \"\n- across Europe in the Iron Age. They differed to their eastern counterparts through the use of earthworks rather than stone as a building material.[37] Many eart\n- hworks survive today, along with evidence of palisades to accompany the ditches. In Europe, oppida emerged in the 2nd&#160;century BC; they were densely inhabit\n- ed fortified settlements, such as the oppidum of Manching, and developed from hill forts.[38] The Romans encountered fortified settlements such as hill forts an\n- \"d oppida when expanding their territory into northern Europe.[38] Although primitive, they were often effective, and required extensive siege engines and other \"\n- siege warfare techniques to overcome, such as at the Battle of Alesia. The Romans\' own fortifications (castra) varied from simple temporary earthworks thrown up\n- \" by armies on the move, to elaborate permanent stone constructions, notably the milecastles of Hadrian\'s Wall. Roman forts were generally rectangular with round\"\n- \"ed corners \\xE2\\x80\\x93 a \\\"playing-card shape\\\".[39]\\n\\\n [edit] Origins and early castles\\n\\\n Like the feudal society they were part of, castles had their origins in the 9th&#160\"\n- ;and 10th&#160;centuries. This period saw the emergence of a social and military elite in the Carolingian Empire and the development of mounted fighting. Fighti\n- ng on horseback was a costly and time consuming endeavour, requiring specialised equipment and trained horses, and for their efforts these early knights were gr\n- anted land by the lords for whom they fought. The link between knight and lord was the basis of feudalism, and could go higher up the social scale with loyaltie\n- s between lords, dukes, princes, and kings. When the Carolingian Empire collapsed in the 9th&#160;and 10th&#160;centuries, it took with it effective centralised\n- \" administration,[40] and it fell to the landed elite to take over control. This led to the privatisation of government, with local lords taking on the responsib\"\n- ility for the local economy and justice. Although castles were private buildings, lordship was a public office and the holder had a responsibility to protect hi\n- s peasants.[41] There is a traditional view that feudalism was a tool of social disintegration that contributed to the downfall of the Carolingian Empire, howev\n- er modern academic opinion is that it was a successor to previous government rather than a rival.[42] Castles sometimes required the permission of the king or o\n- ther high authority. Charles the Bald prohibited the construction of castles without his permission and ordered them destroyed; this could be the earliest refer\n- ence to castles being built without permission, breaking the feudal agreement between lord and vassal, however there are very few castles dated with certainty f\n- \"rom the mid-9th&#160;century. Converted into a donjon in around 950, Dou\\xC3\\xA9-la-Fontaine, in France, is the oldest standing castle in Europe.[43]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n One of the e\"\n- \"arliest representations of a castle from the Bayeux Tapestry. It depicts attackers of Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Dinan in France using fire, one of the threats to wooden castl\"\n- \"es.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Military historian Allen Brown asserts that in the absence of a working state and the breakdown of society associated with the decline of the Carolingian \"\n- \"Empire, feudal ties became more important. The rise of castles is not solely attributed to defence of the new feudal lords\\xE2\\x80\\x99 lands, but as a reaction to attack\"\n- s by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings.[40] It is likely that the castle evolved from the practice of fortifying a lordly home. In a time of social unrest, a lord w\n- \"ould wish to protect his home or hall, and the greatest threat was that of fire as they were usually wooden. To protect against this, and keep other threats at \"\n- \"bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an \"\n- artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers.[44] While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is an\n- cient, raising a motte to exploit the advantages of height is a medieval innovation.[45] A bank and ditch enclosure was a simple form of defence, and when found\n- \" without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enh\"\n- anced by the addition a stone curtain wall.[46] Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door.\n- \" This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 to make it harder to throw objects in&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and to change the entrance from ground floor to\"\n- \" first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls and contained the lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s household.[4\"\n- \"7] Castles were not just used as defensive sites, but to enhance a lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area,[4\"\n- |-\n 8] and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.[49]\n References to castles in texts such as charters from 1000 onwards i\n- ncreased greatly. Historians have interpreted this as evidence of a sudden increase in the number of castles in Europe around this time; their interpretation ha\n- s been supported by archaeologists dating the construction of castle sites through the examination of ceramics.[50] The increase in Italy began in the 950s, wit\n- h numbers of castles increasing by a factor of three to five every 50&#160;years, whereas other parts of Europe such as France and Spain were slower. In 950, Pr\n- ovence was home to 12&#160;castles, by 1000 this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100.[51] Despite the common period in which castles rose to pro\n- \"minence in Europe, their form and design varied from region to region. In the early 11th&#160;century, the motte&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 an artificial mound surmounted by a pa\"\n- \"lisade and tower&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was the most common form of castle in Europe, aside from Scandinavia.[51] Castles were introduced into England shortly before the Norm\"\n- \"an Conquest in 1066.[52] The motte and bailey&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 a motte with an outer enclosure&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 remained the dominant form of castle in England, Wales, and Irel\"\n- |-\n and well into the 12th&#160;century.[53] At the same time, castle architecture in mainland Europe became more sophisticated.[54]\n \n \n \n \n Built in 1138, Castle Risin\n- \"g in England is an example of an elaborate donjon.[55]\\n\\n\\n\\\n The donjon&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 or great tower[56]&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was at the centre of this change in castle architecture\"\n- \" in the 12th&#160;century. Central towers proliferated, and typically had a square plan, with walls 3 to 4&#160;m (9.8 to 13&#160;ft) thick. Their decoration em\"\n- ulated Romanesque architecture, and sometimes incorporated double windows similar to those found in church bell towers. Donjons, which were the residence of the\n- \" lord of the castle, evolved to become more spacious. The changes in design changed from utilitarian to decorative to impose upon the landscape as a symbol of l\"\n- ordly power, sometimes compromising defence for the sake of display.[54] Historians have interpreted the widespread presence of castles across Europe in the 11t\n- |-\n h&#160;and 12th&#160;centuries as evidence that warfare was common, and usually between local lords.[57]\n In some countries, it was necessary to obtain the permi\n- ssion of the king through a licence to crenellate, or else the builder risked it being slighted. This was not universal, as in some countries, the monarch had l\n- \"ittle control over lords, or required the construction of new castles to aid in securing the land&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 as was the case in England after 1066 and the Holy La\"\n- \"nd during the Crusades&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 so was unconcerned about granting permission. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built cast\"\n- les, and as a result there are 4,000 in the country. Before the 12th&#160;century, castles were as uncommon in Denmark as they had been in England before the No\n- |-\n rman Conquest. The introduction of castles to Denmark was a reaction to attacks from Wendish pirates, and they were usually intended as coastal defences.[58]\n [e\n- \"dit] Innovation and scientific design\\n\\\n Until the 12th century, stone-built and earth and timber castles were contemporary,[59] but by the late 12th&#160;century \"\n- the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly attributed to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of t\n- imber and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone.[60] Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork\n- \" castles were by no means useless.[61] This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; at the s\"\n- \"tart of the 15th&#160;century Owain Glynd\\xC5\\xB5r\\xE2\\x80\\x99s castle at Sycharth, founded in the late 11th&#160;century, was a timber structure.[62][63]\\n\\\n In the late 12th&#16\"\n- 0;century, there was an obvious change in castle architecture. Until then, castles probably had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrows\n- lits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the lay of the land, and the resu\n- lt was often irregular or curvilinear. The design of castles was of course not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the m\n- id-12th&#160;century.[64] By the end of the 12th&#160;century or the early 13th&#160;century, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in sh\n- ape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level t\n- o allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall. These later castles would not always have a keep, but this may have been because the more compl\n- \"ex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers provided space for habitation to make up for the \"\n- loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to t\n- \"he castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 although there was great variety in the styles of g\"\n- \"ateway and entrances&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and one or more portcullis.[65]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The gatehouse to the inner ward of Beeston Castle, England, was built in the 1220s and has an \"\n- |-\n entrance between two half-round towers.[66]\n \n \n When seeking to explain this change in the complexity and style of castles, antiquarians found their answer in the\n- \" Crusades. It seemed logical that the Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architectu\"\n- \"re. There were legends such as that of Lalys&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 an architect from Palestine who reputedly went to Wales after the Crusades and greatly enhanced the castle\"\n- \"s in the south of the country&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and it was assumed that great architects such as James of Saint George originated in the East. However, in the mid-20th&#\"\n- 160;century this view was cast into doubt. Legends were discredited, and in the case of James of Saint George, it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d\'E\n- \"sp\\xC3\\xA9ranche, in France. If the innovations in fortification had derived from the East, it would have been expected for their influence to be seen from 1100 onwar\"\n- \"ds, immediately after the Christians were victorious in the First Crusade (1096\\xE2\\x80\\x931099), rather than nearly 100&#160;years later.[67] Roman remains in western E\"\n- urope were still upstanding in many places, and as they too featured flanking round-towers, and entrances between two flanking towers. The castle builders of we\n- stern Europe were aware of and influenced by Roman design as demonstrated by the reuse of Saxon shore forts in England, a late Roman innovation despite their na\n- \"me, and in Spain the wall around the city of Avila imitated Roman architecture when it was built in 1091.[67] It has been argued&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 by historian Smail in \"\n- \"Crusading warfare&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 that the case for the influence of eastern fortification on the west has been overstated, and that crusaders of the 12th&#160;century\"\n- \" in fact learnt very little about scientific design from Byzantine and Saracen defences.[68] The explanation for this is that a well sited castle that made use \"\n- of natural defences and had strong ditches and walls had no need for a scientific design. An example of this approach is Karak Castle. Although there were no sc\n- \"ientific elements to its design it was almost impregnable, and in 1187 Saladin chose to lay siege to the castle and starve out its garrison rather than risk an \"\n- |-\n assault.[68]\n After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did not return to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the principality of Antioch, the\n- \" County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their acquisitions were designed mostly by Syrian mas\"\n- \"ter-masons. Their design was very similar to a Roman fort or Byzantine tetrapyrgia: a square curtain wall with towers in each corner, also usually square and no\"\n- t projecting much beyond the curtain wall. In the interior, the keep would have had a square plan and generally be undecorated.[69] While castles were used to h\n- \"old a site and control movement of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified.[70] Castle architecture in the East became more \"\n- \"complex around the late 12th and early 13th&#160;century after the stalemate of the Third Crusade (1189\\xE2\\x80\\x931192). Both Christians and Muslims created fortificati\"\n- ons, and the character of each was different. Saphadin, the 13th-century ruler of the Saracens, created structures with large rectangular towers that influenced\n- \" Muslim architecture and were copied again and again, however they had little influence on Crusader castles.[71]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Krak des Chevaliers is a concentric castle \"\n- \"built with both rectangular and rounded towers. It is amongst the best preserved Crusader castles.[72]\\n\\n\\n\\\n In the early 13th&#160;century, Crusaders castles were \"\n- mostly built by Military Orders, such as the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Knights of the Teutonic Order. They were responsible for the foundation o\n- f sites such as Krak des Chevaliers, Margat, and Belvoir. The forms of the castle varied not just between orders, but individually from castle to castle, althou\n- gh it was common for the castles founded in this period to have concentric defences.[73] The concept, which originated in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, w\n- as to remove the reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be more than one ring of defensive wall, one i\n- nside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If an assailant made it past the first line o\n- \"f defences into the outer enclosure, they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall to secure \"\n- \"the fall of the castle.[74] Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe, for instance when Edward I of England&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 who had himself been on Crusade&\"\n- \"#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 built castles in Wales in the late 13th&#160;century, four of the eight he founded were concentric.[73][74] Not all the features of the Crusader castle\"\n- s from the 13th &amp;nbspcentury were emulated in Europe; for instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the entrance in the side of a tower and for th\n- ere to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this feature to be found in Europe.\n- |-\n [73]\n It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels; something that contemporary builders in Europe were wary o\n- f, believing that they weakened the wall\'s structural integrity. Arrowslits did not compromise the wall\'s strength, but it was not until Edward I\'s programme of\n- \" castle building that they were adopted in Europe.[25] The Crusades also led to the introduction of machicolations into western architecture. Until the 13th&#16\"\n- 0;century, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed\n- \" the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the \"\n- |-\n East long before the arrival of the Crusades, and perhaps as early as the first half of the 8th&#160;century in Syria.[75]\n Although France has been described as\n- \" \\\"the heartland of medieval architecture\\\", the English were at the forefront of castle architecture in the 12th&#160;century. French historian Francois Gebelin \"\n- said:[76] \"The great revival in military architecture was led, as one would naturally expect, by the powerful kings and princes of the time; by the sons of Will\n- iam the Conqueror and their descendants, the Plantagenets, when they became dukes of Normandy. These were the men who built all the most typical twelfth-century\n- \" fortified castles remaining to-day\\\".[77] Despite this, by the beginning of the 15th&#160;century, the rate of castle construction in England and Wales went int\"\n- o decline; the new castles were generally of a lighter build than earlier structures and presented few innovations, although strong sites were still created suc\n- h as that of Raglan in Wales. At the same time, French castle architecture came to the fore and led the way in the field of medieval fortifications. Across Euro\n- \"pe&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 particularly the Baltic, Germany, and Scotland&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 castles were built well into the 16th&#160;century.[78]\\n\\\n [edit] Advent of gunpowder\\n\\\n Artillery\"\n- \" powered by gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns are not recorded until the 1380s and were unpredictable and inaccurate \"\n- \"weapons.[79] Castles were adapted to allow small guns&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 averaging between 19.6 and 22&#160;kg (43 and 49&#160;lb)&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 to fire from towers. These gun\"\n- s were too heavy for a man to carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle on the edge of the gun port he could fire the weapon. The g\n- \"un ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the \"\n- \"timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there \"\n- is an intact example at in Doornenburg Castle in Denmark. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on t\n- |-\n op to allow the gunner to aim.[80]\n \n \n \n \n The rounded walls of Sarzana Castle in Italy are adaptated to gunpowder.\n \n \n This form is very common in castles adapted fo\n- \"r guns, found in Egypt, Italy, Scotland, and Spain, and elsewhere in between. Other types of port, though less common were horizontal slits&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 allowing on\"\n- \"ly lateral movement&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and large square openings, which allowed greater movement.[80] The use of guns for defence gave rise to artillery castles, such as \"\n- \"that of Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Ham in France, Defences against guns was not developed until a later stage.[81] Ham is an example of the trend for new castles to dispense w\"\n- \"ith earlier features such as machicolations, tall towers, and crenellations.[82]\\n\\\n Bigger guns were developed, and in the 15th&#160;century became an alternative \"\n- \"to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages before the advent\"\n- \" of gunpowder&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 were those of a greater range and greater power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made bigger and bigger. By the 1450s\"\n- \" guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mohammed II at the Siege of Constantinople.[83] The response towards more eff\"\n- ective cannons was to build thicker walls than in previous castles and to prefer round towers as the curving sides were more likely to deflect a shot than a fla\n- \"t surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures had to find a way to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled \"\n- behind a castle\'s curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.[84] Often, castles constructed before the age of gunpowder would be incapable of using gun\n- s as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface fo\n- r the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which\n- \" avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle\'s defences. These could be built from earthier earth or stone and were used to mount w\"\n- |-\n eapons.[85]\n Around 1500, the innovation of the angled bastion over curved was developed in Italy.[86] The elite who were responsible for castle construction wer\n- e forced to choose between the new type which could withstand cannon-fire but as a result was ugly and uncomfortable to live in, or to stick with an earlier mor\n- e elaborate style with had more aesthetic appeal and was more of a status symbol. The second choice was more popular, and while the castle retained its use as a\n- \" status symbol, it became apparent that earlier fortifications were unable to stand up to cannons, and so there was no point in trying to make the site genuinel\"\n- |-\n y defensible.[87]\n \n \n \n \n Fortaleza Ozama in the Dominican Republic was the first castle built in the Americas\n \n \n However, some true castles were built in the Americ\n- \"as by the Spanish, English, and French colonies. The first stage of Spanish fort construction has been termed the \\\"castle period\\\", which lasted from 1492 until \"\n- the end of the 16th&#160;century.[88] Starting with Fortaleza Ozama, \"these castles were essentially European medieval castles transposed to America.\"[89] Among\n- \" other defensive structures (including forts and citadels), castles were also built in New France towards the end of the 17th&#160;century.[89] Where artillery \"\n- \"was not as developed as on the battle-fields of Europe, some of Montreal\'s outlying forts were built like the fortified manor houses of France. Fort Longueuil, \"\n- \"built from 1695\\xE2\\x80\\x931698 by a baronial family, has been described as \\\"the most medieval-looking fort built in Canada\\\".[90] The manor house and stables were within\"\n- \" a fortified bailey, with a tall round turret in each corner. The \\\"most substantial castle-like fort\\\" near Montr\\xC3\\xA9al was Fort Senneville, built in 1692 with squ\"\n- are towers connected by thick stone walls, as well as a fortified windmill.[91] Stone forts such as these served as defensive residences, as well as imposing st\n- |-\n ructures to prevent Iroquois incursions.[92]\n Although castle construction faded towards the 16th&#160;century, they did not necessarily all fall out of use. Som\n- e retained some role in local administration and became law courts, while others are still handed down in aristocratic families as hereditary seats. A particula\n- rly famous example of this is Windsor Castle in England which was founded in the 11th&#160;century and is home to the monarch of the United Kingdom.[93] In othe\n- r cases they still had a role in defence. Tower houses, which are closely related to castles and include pele towers, were defended towers that were permanent r\n- esidences built in the 14th to 17th centuries. Especially common in Ireland and Scotland, they could be up to five storeys high and succeeded common enclosure c\n- \"astles and were built by a greater social range of people. While unlikely to provide as much protection as a more complex castle, they offered security against \"\n- |-\n raiders and other small threats.[94][95]\n [edit] Later use and revival castles\n According to archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham, \"the great country\n- \" houses of the seventeenth to twentieth centuries were, in a social sense, the castles of their day\\\".[96] Although there was a trend for the elite to move from \"\n- \"castles into country houses in the 17th&#160;century, castles were not completely useless. In later conflicts, such as the English Civil War (1641\\xE2\\x80\\x931651), many\"\n- \" castles were refortified, although subsequently slighted to prevent them from being used again.[97]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Neuschwanstein is a 19th-century neo-romantic castle bu\"\n- |-\n ilt by Ludwig II of Bavaria.\n \n \n Artificial ruins became popular in the 18th&#160;century as a manifestation of a romantic interest in the Middle Ages and chivalr\n- y, and as part of the broader Gothic Revival in architecture. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar,\n- \" although differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on el\"\n- ements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but they served no military purpose and were solely for display.[98] Revival or mock castles, mos\n- t of which were country houses, were particularly common in the British Isles, for example Belvoir Castle and Eastnor Castle in England and Castell Coch in Wale\n- \"s.[99] Edwin Lutyens\' Castle Drogo (1911\\xE2\\x80\\x931930) was the last flicker of this movement in England.[100] In Mexico, Chapultepec Castle, a former military strongh\"\n- old, used as the imperial residence of the monarchs of the Second Mexican Empire, was created in the Neo-Classical and Neo-Gothic styles.[101] Also, the 19th-ce\n- |-\n ntury Neuschwanstein is one such revival castle in Germany.[102]\n [edit] Construction\n See also: Medieval technology&#160;and Stonemasonry\n \n \n \n \n Construction of a l\n- |-\n arge tower, with scaffolding and masons at work. The holes mark the position of the scaffolding in earlier stages of construction.\n \n \n Once the site of a castle h\n- \"ad been selected&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 whether a strategic position or one intended to dominate the landscape as a mark of power&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the building material had to be sel\"\n- \"ected. An earth and timber castle was cheaper and easier to erect than one built from stone. The costs involved in construction are not well recorded, and most \"\n- surviving records relate to royal castles.[103] A castle with earthen ramparts, a motte, and timber defences and buildings could have been constructed by an uns\n- killed workforce. The source of man-power was probably from the local lordship, and the tenants would already have the necessary skills of felling trees, diggin\n- g, and working timber necessary for an earth and timber castle. Possibly coerced into working for their lord, the construction of an earth and timber castle wou\n- \"ld not have been a drain on a client\\xE2\\x80\\x99s funds. In terms of time, it has been estimated that an average sized motte&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 5&#160;m (16&#160;ft) high and 15&#\"\n- \"160;m (49&#160;ft) wide at the summit&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 would have taken 50&#160;people about 40&#160;working days. An exceptionally expensive motte and bailey was that \"\n- \"of Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 for \\xC2\\xA320. The high cost, relative to other castles of its type, was because labourers had to be imported.[103]\\n\\\n Although thei\"\n- r cost varied according to factors such as their complexity and transport costs for material, it is certain that stone castles cost a great deal more than those\n- \" built from earth and timber. Even a very small tower, such as Peveril Castle, would have cost around \\xC2\\xA3200. In the middle were castles such as Orford, which wa\"\n- \"s built in the late 12th&#160;century for \\xC2\\xA31,400, and at the upper end were those such as Dover, which cost about \\xC2\\xA37,000 between 1112 and 1191.[104] Spending \"\n- \"on the scale of the vast castles such as Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau Gaillard (an estimated \\xC2\\xA315,000 to \\xC2\\xA320,000 between 1196 and 1198) was easily supported by The Crown, but for \"\n- \"lords of smaller areas, castle building was a very serious and costly undertaking. It was usual for a stone castle to take the best part of a decade to finish. \"\n- \"The cost of a large castle built over this time (anywhere from \\xC2\\xA31,000 to \\xC2\\xA310,000) would take the income from several manors, severely impacting on a lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s \"\n- \"finances.[105] Cost in the late 13th&#160;century were of a similar order, with castles such as Beaumaris and Rhuddlan costing \\xC2\\xA314,500 and \\xC2\\xA39,000 respectively\"\n- \". Edward I\\xE2\\x80\\x99s campaign of castle-building in Wales cost \\xC2\\xA380,000 between 1277 and 1304, and \\xC2\\xA395,000 between 1277 and 1329.[106] Renowned designer Master James\"\n- \" of Saint George, responsible for the construction of Beaumaris, explained the cost:\\n\\n\\\n In case you should wonder where so much money could go in a week, we would\"\n- \" have you know that we have needed&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and shall continue to need 400 masons, both cutters and layers, together with 2,000 less skilled workmen, 100&#160;c\"\n- arts, 60&#160;wagons and 30&#160;boats bringing stone and sea coal; 200&#160;quarrymen; 30&#160;smiths; and carpenters for putting in the joists and floor board\n- s and other necessary jobs. All this takes no account of the garrison&#160;... nor of purchases of material. Of which there will have to be a great quantity&#16\n- \"0;... The men\\xE2\\x80\\x99s pay has been and still is very much in arrears, and we are having the greatest difficulty in keeping them because they have simply nothing to \"\n- |-\n live on.[107]\n \n Not only were stone castles expensive to build in the first place, but their maintenance was a constant drain. They contained a lot of timber, wh\n- \"ich was often unseasoned and as a result needed careful upkeep. Castles such as Exeter and Gloucester were often given figures of between \\xC2\\xA320 and \\xC2\\xA350 annually\"\n- \" in the late 12th&#160;century for constant repairs.[108]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The Castle of the Teutonic Order in Malbork, Poland, is an example of brick-built castle and was b\"\n- \"uilt in a style different to that of castles in western Europe and the Near East.[109]\\n\\n\\n\\\n Medieval machines and inventions, such as the treadwheel crane, became \"\n- indispensable during construction, and techniques of building wooden scaffolding were improved upon from Antiquity.[110] Finding stone for shell keeps and castl\n- \"e walls was the first concern of medieval builders, and a major preoccupation was to have quarries close at hand.[111] There are examples of some castles where \"\n- \"stone was quarried on site, such as Chinon, Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Coucy and Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau Gaillard.[111]\\n\\\n Brick-built structures were not necessarily weaker than their stone-bu\"\n- ilt counterparts. In England, brick production proliferated along the south-east coast due to an influx of Flemish weavers and a reduction in the amount of avai\n- lable, leading to a demand for an alternative building material. Brick castles are less common than stone or earth and timber constructions, and often it was ch\n- \"osen for its aesthetic appeal or because it was in fashion, encouraged by the brick architecture of the Low Countries. For example, when Tattershall Castle was \"\n- built between 1430 and 1450, there was plenty of stone available nearby, however the owner, Lord Cromwell, chose to use brick. About 700,000 bricks were used to\n- \" built the castle, which has been described as \\xE2\\x80\\x9Cthe finest piece of medieval brick-work in England\\xE2\\x80\\x9D.[112] Brick castles were predominant in Scandinavia and \"\n- |-\n the Baltic;[113] Denmark had few quarries, and as a result, most of its castles are earth and timber affairs, or later on built from brick.[114]\n [edit] Social c\n- |\n entre\n Main article: Court (royal)\n \n \n \n \n God Speed! by Edmund Blair Leighton, 1900: a late Victorian view of a lady giving a favour to a knight about to do battle\n\n- \"\\n\\n\\\n Due to the lord\'s presence in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as \"\n- \"without the support of his more powerful tennants, a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately \"\n- below them on the social scale, but absentee lords found their power weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit a\n- ll his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.[115] To allow the l\n- ord to concentrate on his duties regarding administration, he had a household of servants to take care of chores such as providing food. The household was run b\n- y a chamberlain, while a treasurer took care of the estate\'s written records. Royal households took essentially the same form as baronial households, although o\n- n a much larger scale and the positions were more prestigious.[116] Without the presence of a lord\'s household, usually because he was staying elsewhere, a cast\n- le would have been a quiet place with few residents, focused on maintaining the castle.[117] Not just a utilitarian structure, as social centres castles were al\n- \"so important places for display. Builders took the opportunity to draw on symbolism to evoke a sense of chivalry that was aspired to in the Middle Ages amongst \"\n- \"the elite. Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features.[118] The \"\n- \"right to crenelate, when granted by a monarch&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 though it was not always necessary&amp;bsp;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was important not just as it allowed a lord to defend his \"\n- \"property but because crenelations and other accoutrements associated with castles were prestigious through their use by the elite.[119]\\n\\\n The purpose of marriage \"\n- \"between the medieval elites was to secure land, not for love; girls were married in their teens, but boys did not marry until they came of age.[120] There is a \"\n- popular conception that women played a peripheral role in the medieval castle household, and that it was dominated by the lord himself. This derives from the im\n- age of the castle as a martial institution, but most castles in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never involved in conflicts or sieges, so the domest\n- \"ic life is a neglected facet.[121] The lady was given a \\\"marriage portion\\\" of her husband\'s estates&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 usually about a third&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 which were hers for \"\n- life, and her husband would inherit on her death; it was her duty to administer them directly, as the lord administered his own land.[122] Despite generally bei\n- ng excluded from military service, a woman could be in charge of a castle, either on behalf of her lordly husband or if she was widowed. Because of their influe\n- nce within the medieval household women influenced construction and design, sometimes through direct patronage; historian Charles Coulson emphasises the role of\n- \" women in applying \\\"a refined aristocratic taste\\\" to castles due to their long term residence.[123] Courtly love was the eroticisation of love between the nobil\"\n- \"ity. Emphasis was placed on restraint between lovers. It was sometimes in private and was expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments. The legend of \"\n- Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages.[124] It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other,\n- \" although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 Henry I of England had over 20&#160;bast\"\n- \"ards for instance&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.[125]\\n\\\n [edit] Castle landscapes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The approach to Kenilworth Castle, Engl\"\n- |-\n and, was lengthened to form a winding route through a moat and an artificial water landscape.\n \n \n As castles were not simply military buildings but centres of adm\n- inistration and symbols of power, they had a significant impact on the landscape around them. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems d\n- \"ue to their role in managing the lord\'s estate,[126] which gave them greater influence over resources.[127] Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer \"\n- parks and were important in their maintenance. Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, and many were found next to castles. Not only were they practical i\n- |-\n n that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.[128]\n Although sometimes the const\n- \"ruction of a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it is more common for the villages nearby to have grown as a result \"\n- of the presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle.[126] The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confi\n- ned to Europe; when Safad Castle was founded in Galilee, in the Holy Land, during the 13th&#160;century, the nearby town benefited from its presence as people c\n- ould now move freely in the area and the 260&#160;villages locally became profitable.[129] When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local l\n- andscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord.[130] Settlements grew naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of p\n- roximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importa\n- \"nce&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement dep\"\n- |-\n opulated.[131]\n During and shortly after the Norman Conquest of England, castles were inserted into important pre-existing towns to control and subdue the popula\n- ce. They were usually location with reference to any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structur\n- es occupying the desired site. In Lincoln, 166&#160;houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a m\n- oat for the castle. As the military importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and the\n- ir financial and judicial roles.[132] When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11th&#160;and 12th&#160;centuries, settlement in those countr\n- |-\n ies was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns is often linked with the creation of a castle.[133]\n Symbolism in relation to castles and their sett\n- ing was very important, as demonstrated by the proximity of high status features such as fish ponds. Also often found near to a castle, sometimes within its def\n- ences, was the parish church.[134] This has been interpreted as a relationship between the church and feudal lords, where the lords patronised the church, which\n- \" was one of the most important institutions of medieval society.[135] Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military can be\"\n- \" highly symbolic. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 comprising a moat and several satellite ponds&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 forced anyone approaching t\"\n- he castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway.[136] Another example is that of the\n- \" 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advance castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and t\"\n- he moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site look more impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer a\n- round the castle, ensuring they got a good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.[137] This also dem\n- onstrates that licenses to crenellate were not solely about a desire to defend oneself, but to have proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who\n- \" was the one responsible for granting permission.[138]\\n\\\n [edit] Warfare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n A trebuchet at Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau des Baux in France\\n\\n\\n\\\n As a static structure, castles could ofte\"\n- n be avoided as their immediate area of influence was about 400&#160;metres (1,300&#160;ft) and their weapons had a short range even early in the age of artille\n- ry. Although leaving an enemy behind the army would allow them to interfere with communications and make raids in the landscape to harry the army. Garrisons wer\n- e expensive, and as a result often small unless the castle was important.[139] Garrisons were smaller in peace time due to the cost of upkeep, and small castles\n- \" were manned by perhaps a couple of watchmen and gate-guards. Even in war garrisons were not necessarily large as too large a defending force would impair the c\"\n- \"astles ability to withstand a long siege; in 1403 a force of 37&#160;archers successfully defended Caernarfon Castle against two assaults by Owain Glynd\\xC5\\xB5r\'s al\"\n- lies during a long siege.[140] Early on, manning a castle was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later re\n- \"placed with paid forces.[140][141] If it was necessary to control the castle for strategic reasons, an army could lay siege to it and starve the defenders out. \"\n- \"Without relief from an outside source, the defending army would eventually submit, but sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies \"\n- of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later.[142] For th\n- e most heavily fortified sites it was more efficient to starve the garrison out that to assault it. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also a\n- \"pplied to the fortified towns of the day.[143] On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally.[144]\\n\\\n If forced to assault \"\n- \"a castle, there were many options available to the attackers. For wooden structures, such as early motte-and-baileys, fire was a real threat and attempts would \"\n- \"be made to set them on fire.[143] Project weapons had been used since antiquity and the mangonel and petraria&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 from Roman and Oriental origins respectiv\"\n- \"ely&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 were the main two that were used into the Middle Ages. The trebuchet, probably evolved from the petraria in the 13th&#160;century, was the most eff\"\n- \"ective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. \"\n- Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high trajectory of its projectile, and would be protected from direct fi\n- re by the curtain walls.[145] Eventually cannons developed to the point where they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the\n- \" main weapon in siege warfare.[83] Walls could be undermined by the creation of a sap; a mine would be dug to conceal the attackers approach to the wall, with w\"\n- ooden supports to prevent the tunnel from collapsing. When the target had been reached, the supports would be burned, caving in the tunnel and bringing down the\n- \" structure above.[146] Battering rams were also used, usually in the form of a tree trunk given an iron cap. They were used to batter down the castle gates, alt\"\n- \"hough they were sometimes used against walls, but with less effect.[147] As an alternative to creating a breach in the walls, an escalade could be attempted to \"\n- capture the walls, with fighting along the walkways on the curtain walls;[148] in this instance, attackers would be very vulnerable to arrowfire, particularly f\n- \"rom crossbows or the English longbow.[149]\\n\\\n [edit] See also\\n\\n\\\n Alc\\xC3\\xA1zar (Spanish castles)\\n\\\n Shiro (Japanese fortifications)\\n\\n\\\n [edit] References\\n\\n\\\n Notes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2\"\n- |\n 005, pp.&#160;7, 10.\n ^ Creighton &amp; Higham 2003, p.&#160;6.\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;32.\n ^ Allen Brown 2004, p.&#160;1.\n ^ a b Coulson 2003, p.&#160;16.\n\n- \"^ Liddiard 2005, pp.&#160;15\\xE2\\x80\\x9317.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;47.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, p.&#160;18.\\n\\\n ^ Stephens 1969, pp.&#160;452\\xE2\\x80\\x93475.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, pp.&#160;2, 6\\xE2\\x80\\x93\"\n- \"7.\\n\\\n ^ Creighton &amp; Higham 2003, pp.&#160;6\\xE2\\x80\\x937.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, p.&#160;2.\\n\\\n ^ a b Friar 2003, p.&#160;214.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;55.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Bar\"\n- \"th\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 397\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;22.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, pp.&#160;214, 216.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;105.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Barth\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 399\\n\\\n ^\"\n- \" Friar 2003, p.&#160;163.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;188.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;190.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Barth\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 402-6.

Typicall\n- |-\n y, costs are borne in the majority by government-funded programs.\n Universal health care systems vary according to the extent of government involvement in provid\n- ing care and/or health insurance. In some countries, such as the UK, Spain, and the Nordic countries, the government has a high degree of involvement in the com\n- missioning or delivery of health care services and access is based on residence rights not on the purchase of insurance. Others have a much more pluralistic del\n- ivery system based on obligatory health with contributory insurance rates related to salaries or income, and usually funded by employers and beneficiaries joint\n- ly. Sometimes the health funds are derived from a mixture of insurance premiums and government taxes. These insurance based systems tend to have a higher propor\n- \"tion of private medical providers obtaining reimbursement, often at heavily regulated rates, through mutual or publicly owned medical insurers.

In Britain, the National Insurance Act 1911 marked the first steps there towards universal health care, coverin\n- g most employed persons and their financial dependents and all persons who had been continuous contributors to the scheme for at least five years whether they w\n- ere working or not. This system of health insurance continued in force until the creation of the National Health Service in 1948 which extended health care secu\n- rity to all legal residents. Most current universal health care systems were implemented in the period following the Second World War as a process of deliberate\n- \" healthcare reform, intended to make health care available to all, in the spirit of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, signed by e\"\n- |-\n very country doing so. The US did not ratify the social and economic rights sections, including Article 25\'s right to health.[2]\n [edit] Implementation and Compa\n- |-\n risons\n See also: Health care system\n Universal health care is a broad concept that has been implemented in several ways. The common denominator for all such prog\n- rams is some form of government action aimed at extending access to health care as widely as possible and setting minimum standards. Most implement universal he\n- alth care through legislation, regulation and taxation. Legislation and regulation direct what care must be provided, to whom, and on what basis. Usually some c\n- osts are borne by the patient at the time of consumption but the bulk of costs come from a combination of compulsory insurance and tax revenues. Some programs a\n- re paid for entirely out of tax revenues. In others tax revenues are used either to fund insurance for the very poor or for those needing long term chronic care\n- \". The UK government\'s National Audit Office in 2003 published an international comparison of ten different health care systems in ten developed countries, nine \"\n- universal systems against one non-universal system (the U.S.), and their relative costs and key health outcomes.[3] A wider international comparison of 16 count\n- ries, each with universal health care, was published by the World Health Organization in 2004 [4] In some cases, government involvement also includes directly m\n- |-\n anaging the health care system, but many countries use mixed public-private systems to deliver universal health care.\n [edit] Americas\n Argentina, Brazil (see bel\n- ow), Canada (see below), Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico (see below), Panama, Peru (see below), Uruguay, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela all have public unive\n- |-\n rsal health care provided.\n [edit] Brazil\n Main article: Health care in Brazil\n The universal health care system was adopted in Brazil in 1988 after the end of the\n- \" military regime\'s rule.\\n\\\n [edit] Canada\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in Canada\\n\\\n In 1984, the Canada Health Act was passed, which prohibited extra billing by doctors \"\n- on patients while at the same time billing the public insurance system. In 1999, the prime minister and most premiers reaffirmed in the Social Union Framework A\n- \"greement that they are committed to health care that has \\\"comprehensiveness, universality, portability, public administration and accessibility.\\\"[5]\\n\\\n The system \"\n- \"is for the most part publicly funded, yet most of the services are provided by private enterprises or private corporations, although most hospitals are public. \"\n- Most doctors do not receive an annual salary, but receive a fee per visit or service.[6] About 29% of Canadians\' health care is paid for by the private sector o\n- \"r individuals.[7] This mostly goes towards services not covered or only partially covered by Medicare such as prescription drugs, dentistry and vision care.[8] \"\n- \"Many Canadians have private health insurance, often through their employers, that cover these expenses.[9]\\n\\\n The Canada Health Act of 1984 \\\"does not directly bar \"\n- private delivery or private insurance for publicly insured services,\" but provides financial disincentives for doing so. \"Although there are laws prohibiting or\n- \" curtailing private health care in some provinces, they can be changed,\\\" according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.[10][11] The legality of t\"\n- he ban was considered in a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada which ruled in Chaoulli v. Quebec that \"the prohibition on obtaining private health insurance\n- \", while it might be constitutional in circumstances where health care services are reasonable as to both quality and timeliness, is not constitutional where the\"\n- \" public system fails to deliver reasonable services.\\\" The appellant contended that waiting times in Quebec violated a right to life and security in the Quebec C\"\n- harter of Human Rights and Freedoms. The Court agreed, but acknowledged the importance and validity of the Canada Health Act, and at least four of the seven jud\n- \"ges explicitly recognized the right of governments to enact laws and policies which favour the public over the private system and preserve the integrity of the \"\n- |-\n public system.\n [edit] Colombia\n Main article: Health in Colombia\n In 1993 a reform transformed the health care system in Colombia, trying to provide a better, sus\n- |-\n tainable, health care system and to reach every Colombian citizen.\n [edit] Mexico\n Further information: Health care in Mexico\n On December 1, 2006 the Mexican gove\n- \"rnment created the Health Insurance for a New Generation also known as \\\"life insurance for babies\\\".[12][13][14]\\n\\\n On May 28, 2009 Mexico announced Universal Care \"\n- |-\n Coverage for Pregnant Women.[15]\n [edit] Peru\n On April 9, 2009 the Government of Peru published the Law on Health Insurance to enable all Peruvians to access qua\n- lity health services, and contribute to regulate the financing and supervision of these services.

According to the Institute of Medicine of the National A\n- \"cademies of Science, this unfunded \\xE2\\x80\\x9Csafety net\\xE2\\x80\\x9D mandate has contributed to increasing strain on the health system.

Furthermore, this system encourages use of the emergency facilities for primary care and not just for\n- \" emergency purposes.[18]\\n\\\n In lieu of a national program, some states and municipalities have made attempts to approach universality of insurance in their respect\"\n- ive jurisdictions. The state of Massachusetts implemented a near-universal health care system by mandating that residents purchase health insurance by July 1, 2\n- 007.[19] The City of San Francisco is also undertaking a universal health care system for uninsured residents.[20][21] Hawaii has, since 1974, required employer\n- s to provide employees working more than 20 hours per week with a comprehensive health insurance plan.[22] California, Maine and Vermont are also considering or\n- \" seeking to implement universal or near-universal systems.[23] In July, 2009, Connecticut passed into law a plan called SustiNet, with the goal of achieving nea\"\n- |-\n r-universal healthcare coverage by 2014.[24]\n Whether a federal system of universal health care should be implemented in the US remains a hotly debated political\n- \" topic, with Americans divided in their views.\\n\\\n [edit] Asia\\n\\\n Bhutan, Brunei, China,[25] Hong Kong SAR, India[citation needed], Kuwait[citation needed], Qatar[cita\"\n- tion needed], UAE[citation needed], Saudi Arabia[citation needed], Israel,[26] Japan, Malaysia[citation needed], South Korea, Seychelles[citation needed], Sri L\n- |-\n anka,[27] Taiwan,[28], Pakistan[citation needed] and Thailand[citation needed] have universal health care.\n [edit] Bhutan\n Main article: Health in Bhutan\n The Roya\n- \"l Government of Bhutan maintains a policy of free and universal access to primary health care.

The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS), is a new 2005 initiative to overhaul the healthcare system, particularly int\n- ended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, the annual cost of medical cover is 50 yuan (US$7) per person. Of that, 20 yuan is paid i\n- \"n by the central government, 20 yuan by the provincial government and a contribution of 10 yuan is made by the patient. As of September 2007, around 80% of the \"\n- whole rural population of China had signed up (about 685 million people). The system is tiered, depending on the location. If patients go to a small hospital or\n- \" clinic in their local town, the scheme will cover from 70-80% of their bill. If they go to a county one, the percentage of the cost being covered falls to abou\"\n- \"t 60%. And if they need specialist help in a large modern city hospital, they have to bear most of the cost themselves, the scheme would cover about 30% of the \"\n- \"bill.[30]\\n\\\n On January 21, 2009, the Chinese government announced that a total of 850 billion yuan will be provided between 2009 and 2011 in order to improve the \"\n- \"existing health care system.[31]\\n\\\n [edit] Hong Kong SAR\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in Hong Kong\\n\\\n Hong Kong is one of the healthiest places in the world.[32] Because \"\n- of its early health education, professional health services, and well-developed health care and medication system, Hongkongers enjoy a life expectancy of 84 for\n- \" females and 78 for males,[33] which is the second highest in the world, and 2.94 infant mortality rate, the fourth lowest in the world.[34][35]\\n\\\n There are two m\"\n- \"edical schools in Hong Kong, and several schools offering courses in traditional Chinese medicine. The Hospital Authority is a statutory body that operates and \"\n- \"manages all public hospitals. Hong Kong has high standards of medical practice. It has contributed to the development of liver transplantation, being the first \"\n- |-\n in the world to carry out adult to adult live donor liver transplant in 1993.[36]\n [edit] India\n Main article: Healthcare in India\n India has a universal health ca\n- re system run by the local (state or territorial), governments. The government hospitals, some of which are among the best hospitals in India,[37] provide treat\n- |-\n ment at taxpayer expense. Most essential drugs are offered free of charge in these hospitals.\n Government hospitals provide treatment either free or at minimal c\n- harges. For example, an outpatient card at AIIMS (one of the best hospitals in India) costs a one time fee of rupees 10 (Around 20 cents US) and thereafter outp\n- atient medical advice is free. In-hospital treatment costs depend on financial condition of the patient and facilities utilized by him but are usually much less\n- \" than the private sector. For instance, a patient is waived treatment costs if he is below poverty line. Another patient may seek for an air-conditioned room if\"\n- \" he is willing to pay extra for it. The charges for basic in-hospital treatment and investigations are much less compared to the private sector. The cost for th\"\n- |-\n ese subsidies comes from annual allocations from the central and state governments.\n Primary health care is provided by city and district hospitals and rural pri\n- mary health centres (PHCs). These hospitals provide treatment free of cost. Primary care is focused on immunization, prevention of malnutrition, pregnancy, chil\n- d birth, postnatal care, and treatment of common illnesses.[citation needed] Patients who receive specialized care or have complicated illnesses are referred to\n- \" secondary (often located in district and taluk headquarters) and tertiary care hospitals (located in district and state headquarters or those that are teaching\"\n- \" hospitals).[citation needed] However, the fact that the government sector is understaffed and underfinanced and poor services at state run hospitals forces man\"\n- |-\n y people to visit private medical practitioners.\n Now organizations like Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotional Trust and other private organizations have s\n- |-\n tarted creating hospitals and clinics in India, which also provide free or subsidized health care and subsidized insurance plans.[citation needed]\n [edit] Israel\n- |-\n \n Main article: Health care in Israel\n \n \n \n \n \n This section does not cite any references or sources.

(October 2009)\\n\\n\\n\\\n In Israel, the National Health Insurance Law (or National Health Insurance Act) is \"\n- the legal framework which enables and facilitates basic, compulsory universal health care. The Law was put into effect by the Knesset on January 1, 1995, and wa\n- s based on recommendations put forward by a National Committee of Inquiry which examined restructuring the health care system in Israel in the late 1980s. Prior\n- \" to the law\'s passage approximately 85% of the population was already covered by voluntarily belonging to one of four nation-wide, not-for-profit health mainten\"\n- ance organizations (HMOs/sick funds). However, there were three problems associated with this arrangement. First, membership in the largest HMO, Clalit, require\n- \"d one to belong to the Histadrut labor organization, even if a person did not wish to (or could not) have such an affiliation while other HMOs restricted entry \"\n- to new members based on age, pre-existing conditions or other factors. Second, different HMOs provided different levels of benefit coverage or services to their\n- \" members and lastly was the issue mentioned above whereby a certain percentage of the population, albeit a small one, did not have health insurance coverage at \"\n- |-\n all.\n \n \n \n \n \n This section may stray from the topic of the article&#160;into the topic of another article, Health care in Israel. Please help improve this section o\n- |-\n r discuss this issue on the talk page.\n \n \n Before the law went into effect, all the HMOs collected premiums directly from members. However, upon passage of the la\n- w, a new progressive national health insurance tax was levied through Israel\'s social security agency which then re-distributes the proceeds to the HMOs based o\n- n their membership and its demographic makeup. This ensured that all citizens would now have health coverage. While membership in one of the HMOs now became com\n- pulsory for all, free choice was introduced into movement of members between HMOs (a change is allowed once per year), effectively making the various HMOs compe\n- te equally for members among the populace. Annually, a committee appointed by the ministry of health publishes a \"basket\" or uniform package of medical services\n- \" and prescription formulary which all HMOs must provide as a minimum service to all their members. Achieving this level of equality ensured that all citizens ar\"\n- e guaranteed to receive basic healthcare regardless of their HMO affiliation which was one of the principal aims of the law. An appeals process was put in place\n- \" to handle rejection of treatments and procedures by the HMOs and evaluating cases falling outside the \\\"basket\\\" of services or prescription formulary.\\n\\\n While the\"\n- \" law is generally considered a success and Israeli citizens enjoy a high standard of medical care comparatively, with more competition having been introduced in\"\n- \"to the field of health care in the country, and order having been brought into what was once a somewhat disorganized system, the law nevertheless does have its \"\n- critics. First and foremost among the criticisms raised is that the \"basket\" may not provide enough coverage. To partly address this issue, the HMOs and insuran\n- \"ce companies (often in conjunction with employers) began offering additional \\\"supplementary\\\" insurance to cover certain additional services not included in the \"\n- \"basket. However, since this insurance is optional, critics argue that it goes against the spirit of the new law which stressed equality among all citizens with \"\n- respect to healthcare. Another criticism is that in order to provide universal coverage to all, the tax income base amount (the maximum amount of yearly earning\n- s that are subject to the tax) was set rather high, causing many high-income taxpayers to see the amount they pay for their health premiums (now health tax) sky\n- |-\n rocket. Finally, some complain about the constantly rising costs of copayments for certain services.\n [edit] Singapore\n Main article: Health care in Singapore\n Sin\n- gapore has a universal health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through compulsory savings and price controls, while the private secto\n- r provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources.[38] Singapore currently has the\n- \" lowest infant mortality rate in the world (equaled only by Iceland) and among the highest life expectancies from birth, according to the World Health Organizat\"\n- ion.[39] Singapore has \"one of the most successful healthcare systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in communi\n- ty health outcomes,\" according to an analysis by global consulting firm Watson Wyatt.[40] Singapore\'s system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payro\n- \"ll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as \\\"actively regulating the supply \"\n- and prices of healthcare services in the country\" to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a \"very difficult system to r\n- eplicate in many other countries.\" Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by t\n- \"he government\'s programs.[40]\\n\\\n [edit] Taiwan (Republic of China)\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in Taiwan\\n\\\n The current health care system in Taiwan, known as National \"\n- Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars\n- . The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.[41] NHI is mainly financed t\n- hrough premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-fo\n- |-\n r-service predominated for both public and private providers.\n NHI delivers universal coverage offered by a government-run insurer. The working population pays p\n- \"remiums split with their employers, others pay a flat rate with government help and the poor or veterans are fully subsidized. Taiwan\\xE2\\x80\\x99s citizens no longer hav\"\n- |-\n e to worry about going bankrupt due to medical bills.[42]\n Under this model, citizens have free range to choose hospitals and physicians without using a gatekeep\n- \"er and do not have to worry about waiting lists. NHI offers a comprehensive benefit package that covers preventive medical services, prescription drugs, dental \"\n- \"services, Chinese medicine, home nurse visits and many more. Working people do not have to worry about losing their jobs or changing jobs because they will not \"\n- lose their insurance. Since NHI, the previously uninsured have increased their usage of medical services. Most preventive services are free such as annual check\n- \"ups and maternal and child care. Regular office visits have co-payments as low as US $5 per visit. Co-payments are fixed and unvaried by the person\\xE2\\x80\\x99s income.[\"\n- |-\n 43]\n [edit] Thailand\n Main article: Health care in Thailand\n Thailand introduced universal coverage reforms in 2001, becoming one of only a handful of lower-middle\n- \" income countries to do so. Means-tested health care for low income households was replaced by a new and more comprehensive insurance scheme, originally known a\"\n- s the 30 baht project, in line with the small co-payment charged for treatment. People joining the scheme receive a gold card which allows them to access servic\n- es in their health district, and, if necessary, be referred for specialist treatment elsewhere. The bulk of finance comes from public revenues, with funding all\n- ocated to Contracting Units for Primary Care annually on a population basis. According to the WHO, 65% of Thailand\'s health care expenditure in 2004 came from t\n- he government, 35% was from private sources.[38] Although the reforms have received a good deal of critical comment, they have proved popular with poorer Thais,\n- \" especially in rural areas, and survived the change of government after the 2006 military coup. The then Public Health Minister, Mongkol Na Songkhla, abolished \"\n- \"the 30 baht co-payment and made the UC scheme free. It is not yet clear whether the scheme will be modified further under the coalition government that came to \"\n- |-\n power in January 2008.[44][45][46]\n [edit] Europe\n Virtually all of Europe has publicly sponsored and regulated universal health care. The public plans in some co\n- \"untries provide basic or \\\"sick\\\" coverage only; their citizens can purchase supplemental insurance for additional coverage. Countries with universal health care \"\n- include Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, I\n- celand, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal,[47] Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, S\n- |-\n lovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine[48] and the United Kingdom.[49]\n [edit] Austria\n In Austria, public health care (the care, not the running of hospita\n- ls itself) is funded by means of so called \"Social insurance contributions\" accounting for approx. 24% of the salary, they are therefore no taxes as such. 7% of\n- \" the contribution is reserved for health coverage in one of Austria\'s 22 public insurances, but cannot exceed EUR 281,- monthly (USD 399,-). Depending on the jo\"\n- b, somebody will be insured at one of the 9 state-run territorial health funds or at job specific insurances, e.g. public employees or farmers have their own (c\n- ompulsory) health insurance. 22 public insurances for 8 million people is subject to violent criticism, as tremendous savings could be reached by unifying the i\n- nsurances to one centralized provider. However, no Austrian state is willing to give up its own public insurances as it is sphere of action for electoral campai\n- gns. The operation of hospitals is not paid by social contributions, but by taxes. This means that general health coverage adds up to much more and is therefore\n- \" more expensive as often depicted. Austria spends approx. 10% of its GDP for health coverage.\\n\\\n [edit] Finland\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in Finland\\n\\\n In Finland, pub\"\n- lic medical services at clinics and hospitals are run by the municipalities (local government) and are funded 76% by taxation, 20% by patients through access ch\n- arges, and 4% by others. Private provision is mainly in the primary care sector. There are a few private hospitals [50]. The main hospitals are either municipal\n- \"ly owned (funded from local taxes) or run by the medical teaching universities (funded jointly by the municipalities and the national government). According to \"\n- \"a survey published by the European Commission in 2000, Finland\'s is in the top 4 of EU countries in terms of satisfaction with their hospital care system: 88% o\"\n- f Finnish respondents were satisfied compared with the EU average of 41.3%.[51] Finnish health care expenditures are below the European average.[citation needed\n- \"] The private medical sector accounts for about 14 percent of total health care spending. Only 8% of doctors choose to work in private practice, and some of the\"\n- |-\n se also choose to do some work in the public sector.[citation needed]\n Taxation funding is partly local and partly nationally based. The national social insuranc\n- e institution KELA reimburses part of patients prescription costs and makes a contribution towards private medical costs (including dentistry) if they choose to\n- \" be treated in the private sector rather than the public sector. Patient access charges are subject to annual caps. For example GP visits cost \\xE2\\x82\\xAC11 per visit w\"\n- \"ith annual \\xE2\\x82\\xAC33 cap; hospital outpatient treatment \\xE2\\x82\\xAC22 per visit; a hospital stay, including food, medical care and medicines \\xE2\\x82\\xAC26 per 24 hours, or \\xE2\\x82\\xAC12 if\"\n- \" in a psychiatric hospital. After a patient has spent \\xE2\\x82\\xAC590 per year on public medical services (including prescription drugs), all treatment and medications t\"\n- |-\n hereafter in that year are free.\n [edit] Germany\n Main article: Health care in Germany\n Germany has the world\'s oldest universal health care system, with origins d\n- \"ating back to Otto von Bismarck\'s Health Insurance Act of 1883.[52] As mandatory health insurance, it originally applied only to low-income workers and certain \"\n- government employees, but has gradually expanded to cover the great majority of the population.[53] The system is decentralized with private practice physicians\n- \" providing ambulatory care, and independent, mostly non-profit hospitals providing the majority of inpatient care. Approximately 92% of the population is covere\"\n- d by a \'Statutory Health Insurance\' plan, which provides a standardized level of coverage through any one of approximately 1100 public or private sickness funds\n- . Standard insurance is funded by a combination of employee contributions, employer contributions and government subsidies on a scale determined by income level\n- . Higher income workers sometimes choose to pay a tax and opt out of the standard plan, in favor of \'private\' insurance. The latter\'s premiums are not linked to\n- \" income level but instead to health status.[54]\\n\\\n Historically, the level of provider reimbursement for specific services is determined through negotiations betwe\"\n- \"en regional physician\'s associations and sickness funds. Since 1976 the government has convened an annual commission, comprised of representatives of business, \"\n- labor, physicians, hospitals, and insurance and pharmaceutical industries.[55] The commission takes into account government policies and makes recommendations t\n- \"o regional associations with respect to overall expenditure targets. In 1986 expenditure caps were implemented and were tied to the age of the local population \"\n- as well as the overall wage increases. Although reimbursement of providers is on a fee-for-service basis the amount to be reimbursed for each service is determi\n- ned retrospectively to ensure that spending targets are not exceeded. Capitated care, such as that provided by U.S. health maintenance organizations, has been c\n- onsidered as a cost containment mechanism but would require consent of regional medical associations, and has not materialized.[56] Copayments were introduced i\n- n the 1980s in an attempt to prevent overutilization and control costs. The average length of hospital stay in Germany has decreased in recent years from 14 day\n- s to 9 days, still considerably longer than average stays in the U.S. (5 to 6 days).[57][58] The difference is partly driven by the fact that hospital reimburse\n- ment is chiefly a function of the number of hospital days as opposed to procedures or the patient\'s diagnosis. Drug costs have increased substantially, rising n\n- \"early 60% from 1991 through 2005. Despite attempts to contain costs, overall health care expenditures rose to 10.7% of GDP in 2005, comparable to other western \"\n- |-\n European nations, but substantially less than that spent in the U.S. (nearly 16% of GDP).[59]\n [edit] Ireland\n Main article: Health care in Ireland\n The public hea\n- \"lth care system of the Republic of Ireland is governed by the Health Act 2004, which established a new body to be responsible for providing health and personal \"\n- social services to everyone living in Ireland - the Health Service Executive. The new national health service came into being officially on 1 January 2005; howe\n- ver the new structures are currently in the process of being established as the reform programme continues. In addition to the public-sector, there is also a la\n- |-\n rge private healthcare market.\n [edit] Netherlands\n Main article: Health care in the Netherlands\n The Netherlands has a dual-level system. All primary and curative\n- \" care (i.e. the family doctor service and hospitals and clinics) is financed from private compulsory insurance. Long term care for the elderly, the dying, the l\"\n- ong term mentally ill etc. is covered by social insurance funded from taxation. According to the WHO, the health care system in the Netherlands was 62% governme\n- |-\n nt funded and 38% privately funded as of 2004.[38]\n Insurance companies must offer a core universal insurance package for the universal primary, curative care wh\n- ich includes the cost of all prescription medicines. They must do this at a fixed price for all. The same premium is paid whether young or old, healthy or sick.\n- \" It is illegal in The Netherlands for insurers to refuse an application for health insurance, to impose special conditions (e.g. exclusions, deductibles, co-pay\"\n- \"s etc or refuse to fund treatments which a doctor has determined to be medically necessary). The system is 50% financed from payroll taxes paid by employers to \"\n- \"a fund controlled by the Health regulator. The government contributes an additional 5% to the regulator\'s fund. The remaining 45% is collected as premiums paid \"\n- by the insured directly to the insurance company. Some employers negotiate bulk deals with health insurers and some even pay the employees\' premiums as an emplo\n- yment benefit). All insurance companies receive additional funding from the regulator\'s fund. The regulator has sight of the claims made by policyholders and th\n- \"erefore can redistribute the funds its holds on the basis of relative claims made by policy holders. Thus insurers with high payouts will receive more from the \"\n- regulator than those with low payouts. Thus insurance companies have no incentive to deter high cost individuals from taking insurance and are compensated if th\n- ey have to pay out more than might be expected. Insurance companies compete with each other on price for the 45% direct premium part of the funding and try to n\n- \"egotiate deals with hospitals to keep costs low and quality high. The competition regulator is charged with checking for abuse of dominant market positions and \"\n- the creation of cartels that act against the consumer interests. An insurance regulator ensures that all basic policies have identical coverage rules so that no\n- \" person is medically disadvantaged by his or her choice of insurer.\\n\\\n Hospitals in the Netherlands are also regulated and inspected but are mostly privately run a\"\n- nd for profit, as are many of the insurance companies. Patients can choose where they want to be treated and have access to information on the internet about th\n- e performance and waiting times at each hospital. Patients dissatisfied with their insurer and choice of hospital can cancel at any time but must make a new agr\n- |-\n eement with another insurer.\n Insurance companies can offer additional services at extra cost over and above the universal system laid down by the regulator, e.g\n- \". for dental care. The standard monthly premium for health care paid by individual adults is about \\xE2\\x82\\xAC100 per month. Persons on low incomes can get assistance f\"\n- rom the government if they cannot afford these payments. Children under 18 are insured by the system at no additional cost to them or their families because the\n- \" insurance company receives the cost of this from the regulator\'s fund.\\n\\\n [edit] United Kingdom\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in the United Kingdom\\n\\\n Each of the Countri\"\n- \"es of the United Kingdom has a National Health Service that provides public healthcare to all UK permanent residents that is free at the point of need and paid \"\n- for from general taxation. However, since Health is a devolved matter, considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries.[60]\n- |-\n \n [edit] England\n Main article: Healthcare in England\n The National Health Service (NHS), created by the National Health Service Act 1946 has provided the majority\n- \" of healthcare in England since its launch on 5 July 1948.\\n\\\n The NHS Constitution for England documents at high level, the objectives of the NHS, the legal rights\"\n- \" and responsibilities of the various parties (patients, staff, NHS trust boards) and the guiding principles which govern the service.[61] The NHS constitution m\"\n- \"akes it clear that it provides a comprehensive service, available to all irrespective of age, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, religion or belief; \"\n- \"that access to NHS services is based on clinical need and not an individual\\xE2\\x80\\x99s ability to pay; and that care is never refused on unreasonable grounds. Patient \"\n- choice in terms of doctor, care, treatments and place of treatment is an important aspect of the NHS\'s ambition, and in some cases patients can elect for treatm\n- ent in other European countries at the NHS\'s expense. Wait times are low, with most people able to see their primary care doctor on the same day or the followin\n- g day[62] and only 36.1% of hospital admissions are from a waiting list, with the remainder being either emergencies admitted immediately or else pre-booked adm\n- issions or similar (e.g. child birth) [63]. No patient should experience a delay of more than 18 weeks from initial hospital referral to final treatment[64]. Th\n- |-\n is includes the time for all investigative tests and consultations, and two thirds of patients are currently treated in under 12 weeks.[65]\n Although centrally f\n- \"unded there is no large central bureaucracy to manage it. Responsibility is highly devolved to geographical areas through Strategic Health Authorities and even \"\n- more locally through NHS primary care trusts , NHS hospital trusts and increasingly to NHS foundation trusts which are providing even more decentralized service\n- s within the NHS framework, with more decision making taken by local people, patients and staff. The central government office, the Department of Health, is not\n- \" involved in day to day decision making in either the Strategic Health Authorities or the individual local trusts (primarily health, hospital or ambulance) or t\"\n- he national specialist trusts such as NHS Blood and Transplant, but it does lay down general guidelines for them to follow. Local trusts are accountable to thei\n- |-\n r local populations, whilst government ministers are accountable to Parliament for the service overall.\n The NHS provides, among other things, primary care, in-p\n- \"atient care, long-term healthcare, psychiatric care and treatments ophthalmology and dentistry. All treatment is free with the exception of certain charges for \"\n- prescriptions, dentistry and ophthalmology (which themselves are free to children, the elderly, the unemployed and those on low incomes). Eighty-nine percent of\n- \" NHS prescriptions are obtained free of charge, mosly children, pensioners and pregnat women. Others pay a flat rate of \\xC2\\xA37.20[66], and others may cap their ann\"\n- ual charges. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance. Private insurance accounts for only 4 percent of heal\n- th expenditure and covers little more than a tenth of the population. [67]. Private insurers in the UK only cover acute care from specialists. They do not cover\n- \" generalist consultations, pre-existing conditions, medical emergencies, organ transplants, chronic conditions such as diabetes or conditions such as pregnancy \"\n- or HIV. [68] Most NHS general practitioners are private doctors who contract to provide NHS services but most hospitals are publicly owned and run through NHS T\n- rusts. A few NHS medical services such as \"surgicentres\") are sub-contracted to private providers [69] as are some non-medical services (such as catering). Some\n- \" capital projects such as new hospitals have been funded through the Private Finance Initiative, enabling investment without excessive strain on the public sect\"\n- |-\n or borrowing requirement.\n [edit] Northern Ireland\n Main article: Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland\n Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland is the des\n- |-\n ignation of the national public health service in Northern Ireland.\n [edit] Scotland\n Main article: Healthcare in Scotland\n NHS Scotland, created by the National H\n- ealth Service (Scotland) Act 1947, was also launched on 5 July 1948 though it has always been a separate organisation. Since devolution, NHS Scotland follows th\n- |-\n e policies and priorities of the Scottish Government, including the phasing out of all prescription charges by 2011.\n [edit] Wales\n Main article: Healthcare in Wa\n- |-\n les\n NHS Wales was originally formed as part of the same NHS structure created by the National Health Service Act 1946 but powers over the NHS in Wales came unde\n- |-\n r the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969[70], in turn being transferred under devolution to what is now the Welsh Assembly Government.\n [edit] Oceania\n [edit] A\n- \"ustralia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Medicare\'s logo\\n\\n\\n\\\n Main article: Medicare (Australia)\\n\\\n In Australia, Medibank \\xE2\\x80\\x94 as it was then known \\xE2\\x80\\x94 was introduced, by the Whitlam Labor gover\"\n- nment on 1 July 1975, through the Health Insurance Act 1973. The Australian Senate rejected the changes multiple times and they were passed only after a joint s\n- itting after the 1974 double dissolution election. However, Medibank was supported by the subsequent Fraser Coalition (Australia) government and became a key fe\n- \"ature of Australia\\xE2\\x80\\x99s public policy landscape. The exact structure of Medibank/Medicare, in terms of the size of the rebate to doctors and hospitals and the wa\"\n- y it has administered, has varied over the years. The original Medibank program proposed a 1.35% levy (with low income exemptions) but these bills were rejected\n- \" by the Senate, and so Medibank was funded from general taxation. In 1976, the Fraser Government introduced a 2.5% levy and split Medibank in two: a universal s\"\n- |-\n cheme called Medibank Public and a government-owned private health insurance company, Medibank Private.\n During the 1980s, Medibank Public was renamed Medicare b\n- y the Hawke Labor government, which also changed the funding model, to an income tax surcharge, known as the Medicare Levy, which was set at 1.5%, with exemptio\n- ns for low income earners.[71] The Howard Coalition government introduced an additional levy of 1.0%, known as the Medicare Levy Surcharge, for those on high an\n- nual incomes ($70,000) and do not have adequate levels of private hospital coverage.[72] This was part of an effort by the Coalition to encourage take-up of pri\n- vate health insurance. According to WHO, government funding covered 67.5% of Australia\'s health care expenditures in 2004; private sources covered the remaining\n- \" 32.5% of expenditures.[38]\\n\\\n [edit] New Zealand\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in New Zealand\\n\\\n As with Australia, New Zealand\'s healthcare system is funded through gen\"\n- eral taxation. According to the WHO, government sources covered 77.4% of New Zealand\'s health care costs in 2004; private expenditures covered the remaining 22.\n- |-\n 6%.[38]\n [edit] Economics\n Main article: Health care economics\n [edit] Funding models\n Universal health care in most countries has been achieved by a mixed model of\n- \" funding. General taxation revenue is the primary source of funding, but in many countries it is supplemented by specific levies (which may be charged to the in\"\n- dividual and/or an employer) or with the option of private payments (either direct or via optional insurance) for services beyond that covered by the public sys\n- |-\n tem.\n Almost all European systems are financed through a mix of public and private contributions.[73] The majority of universal health care systems are funded pr\n- imarily by tax revenue (e.g. Portugal[73] and Spain). Some nations, such as Germany, France[49] and Japan[74] employ a multi-payer system in which health care i\n- s funded by private and public contributions. However, much of the non-government funding is by defined contributions by employers and employees to regulated no\n- |-\n n-profit sickness funds. These contributions are compulsory and vary according to a person\'s salary, and are effectively a form of hypothecated taxation.\n A dist\n- inction is also made between municipal and national healthcare funding. For example, one model is that the bulk of the healthcare is funded by the municipality,\n- \" speciality healthcare is provided and possibly funded by a larger entity, such as a municipal co-operation board or the state, and the medications are paid by \"\n- |-\n a state agency.\n Universal health care systems are modestly redistributive. Progressivity of health care financing has limited implications for overall income in\n- |-\n equality.[75]\n [edit] Single-payer\n Main article: Single-payer health care\n The term single-payer health care is used in the United States to describe a funding me\n- chanism meeting the costs of medical care from a single fund. Although the fund holder is usually the government, some forms of single-payer employ a public-pri\n- |-\n vate system.\n [edit] Public\n Some countries (notably the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain) have eliminated insurance entirely and choose to fund health care direct\n- ly from taxation. Other countries with insurance-based systems effectively meet the cost of insuring those unable to insure themselves via social security arran\n- |\n gements funded from taxation, either by directly paying their medical bills or by paying for insurance premiums for those affected.\n [edit] Compulsory insurance\n\n- This is usually enforced via legislation requiring residents to purchase insurance, though sometimes, in effect, the government provides the insurance. Sometime\n- s there may be a choice of multiple public and private funds providing a standard service (e.g. as in Germany) or sometimes just a single public fund (as in Can\n- |-\n ada).\n In some European countries where there is private insurance and universal health care, such as Germany, Belgium, and The Netherlands, the problem of adver\n- se selection (see Private insurance below) is overcome using a risk compensation pool to equalize, as far as possible, the risks between funds. Thus a fund with\n- \" a predominantly healthy, younger population has to pay into a compensation pool and a fund with an older and predominantly less healthy population would receiv\"\n- e funds from the pool. In this way, sickness funds compete on price and there is no advantage to eliminate people with higher risks because they are compensated\n- \" for by means of risk-adjusted capitation payments. Funds are not allowed to pick and choose their policyholders or deny coverage, but then mainly compete on pr\"\n- |-\n ice and service. In some countries the basic coverage level is set by the government and cannot be modified.[76]\n Ireland at one time had a \"community rating\" sy\n- \"stem through VHI, effectively a single-payer or common risk pool. The government later opened VHI to competition but without a compensation pool. This resulted \"\n- in foreign insurance companies entering the Irish market and offering cheap health insurance to relatively healthy segments of the market which then made higher\n- \" profits at VHI\'s expense. The government later re-introduced community rating through a pooling arrangement and at least one main major insurance company, BUPA\"\n- \", then withdrew from the Irish market.\\n\\\n [edit] Private insurance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n This article may be inaccurate in or unbalanced towards certain viewpoints. Please improve \"\n- |-\n the article by adding information on neglected viewpoints, or discuss the issue on the talk page. (June 2009)\n \n \n In some countries with universal coverage, priva\n- te insurance often excludes many health conditions which are expensive and which the state health care system can provide. For example in the UK, one of the lar\n- |-\n gest private health care providers is BUPA which has the following list of general exclusions[77].\n Dental/oral treatment (such as fillings, gum disease, jaw shr\n- \"inkage, etc)\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; pregnancy and childbirth\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; temporary relief of symptoms\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; convalescence, rehabilitation and general nursing care\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; drugs and dressings fo\"\n- \"r out-patient or take-home use\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; screening and preventive treatment; birth control, conception, sexual problems and sex changes\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; allergies or allergic diso\"\n- \"rders; chronic conditions\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; eyesight\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; physical aids and devices\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; *deafness; cosmetic, reconstructive or weight loss treatment\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; ageing, menopaus\"\n- \"e and puberty&#160;; dialysis\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; complications from excluded or restricted conditions/ treatment&#160;; HRT and bone densitometry\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; learning difficulti\"\n- \"es, behavioural and developmental problems&#160;; overseas treatment and repatriation&#160;; AIDS/HIV\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; pre-existing or special conditions&#160;; experi\"\n- \"mental drugs and treatment\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; sleep problems and disorders&#160;; speech disorders\\xE2\\x80\\xA0\\n\\\n all of which (except overseas repatriation) are available for free \"\n- \"or very low cost from the NHS. (\\xE2\\x80\\xA0 indicates that treatment may be provided in certain circumstances)\\n\\\n Where voluntary insurance (often private) is predominant,\"\n- \" such as in the U.S., medical (health) insurance is subject to the well-known economic problem of adverse selection which may also be referred to as a market fa\"\n- ilure.[citation needed] Adverse selection in insurance markets occurs because those providing insurance have limited information with which to estimate the heal\n- th risks on which they may need to pay future claims.[citation needed] In simple terms, those with poor health are more likely to apply for insurance and more l\n- ikely to need treatments requiring high insurance company payouts.[citation needed] Those with good health may find the cost of insurance too high for the perce\n- ived benefit, and some will remove themselves from the risk pool.[citation needed] This adverse selection concentrates the risk pool, thereby further raising co\n- sts.[citation needed] In practical terms, the potential for adverse selection means that private insurers have an economic incentive to use medical underwriting\n- \" to \'weed out\' high cost applicants in order to avoid adverse selection.[citation needed] Among the potential solutions posited by economists are single payer s\"\n- ystems as well as other methods of ensuring that health insurance is universal, such as by requiring all citizens to purchase insurance and limiting the ability\n- \" of insurance companies to deny insurance to individuals or vary price between individuals.[78][79]\\n\\n\\\n [edit] See also\\n\\n\\\n Health care compared - tabular comparisons\"\n- \" of the US, Canada, and other countries not shown above.\\n\\\n Health care reform debate in the United States\\n\\\n Health insurance cooperative\\n\\\n Millennium Development Goal\"\n- |-\n s\n National health insurance\n Publicly-funded health care\n Single-payer health care\n \n [edit] References\n \n \n ^ a b Insuring America\'s Health: Principles and Recommenda\n- |-\n tions, Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science, 2004-01-14\n ^ \"Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Questions and Answers\" (PDF).

The term has a history of scholarly debate surrounding its precise meaning, but a castle is usually considered to be the \"private fortif\n- ied residence\" of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a fortress, which was not a home, or a fortified town, which was a public defence. Over the extended pe\n- riod of time that castles were built they took on a great many forms with many different features, but some, such as the curtain wall and arrow slits, were comm\n- |-\n onplace.\n Castles originated in the 9th&#160;and 10th&#160;centuries, when the fall of the Carolingian Empire in Europe and the rise of feudal society led to the\n- \" territory of the collapsing empire being divided between individual lords and princes, and an emphasis on personal defence. Castles controlled their immediate \"\n- areas, and were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as protection from an enemy. Although t\n- \"heir military origins are often emphasised, castles also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local \"\n- |-\n populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near elements such as a mill, integral to life in the community.\n Many castles were o\n- riginally built from earth and timber, and had their defences replaced later by stone equivalents. In the late 12th&#160;and early 13th&#160;century, a scientif\n- ic approach to castle defence emerged. Towers proliferated, with an emphasis on flanking fire, and many new castles were polygonal, while previously they had re\n- \"lied more on the lay of the land and were curvilinear, or relied on concentric defence&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 several stages of defence within each other that could all funct\"\n- ion at the same time, thereby maximising the castle\'s firepower. The origin of these changes in defence has been attributed to a mixture of influence from the C\n- \"rusades&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 where castle technology was advanced such as the new type of concentric fortification&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and drawing on earlier defences such as Roman fo\"\n- rts for inspiration. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, and devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defen\n- |-\n ce into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress, and to dominate their landscape.\n Gunpowder, introduced to Europe i\n- n the 14th&#160;century, did not have an immediate impact on castle building. Castles do not show adaptation to resist bombardment by cannons until the 15th&#16\n- \"0;century, when artillery became powerful enough to break down walls. Although castles were built across Europe well into the 16th&#160;century, new techniques \"\n- to deal with improved cannon eventually led to them becoming uncomfortable and undesirable places to live, and so true castles went into decline, replaced by ar\n- tillery forts with no role in administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18th&#160;century onwards, there was a renewed interest in cas\n- |-\n tles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no defensive purpose.\n \n \n \n \n Contents\n \n \n 1 Definition\n \n 1\n- |-\n .1 Etymology\n 1.2 Defining characteristics\n \n \n 2 Common features\n \n 2.1 Motte\n 2.2 Bailey and enceinte\n 2.3 Keep\n 2.4 Curtain wall\n 2.5 Moat\n 2.6 Gatehouse\n 2.7 Other feat\n- |+\n ures\n \n \n 3 History\n \n 3.1 Antecedents\n 3.2 Origins and early castles\n 3.3 Innovation and scientific design\n 3.4 Advent of gunpowder\n 3.5 Later use and revival castles\n \n- |-\n \n 4 Construction\n 5 Social centre\n 6 Castle landscapes\n 7 Warfare\n 8 See also\n 9 References\n 10 Further reading\n 11 External links\n \n \n \n \n \n //<![CDATA[\n if (window.showTocTo\n- |-\n ggle) { var tocShowText = \"show\"; var tocHideText = \"hide\"; showTocToggle(); } \n //]]>\n \n [edit] Definition\n [edit] Etymology\n \n \n \n \n The Norman \"White Tower\", the keep\n- \" of the Tower of London, exemplifies all uses of a castle: city defence, a residence, and a place of refuge in times of crisis.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Castle is derived from the Lat\"\n- \"in word castellum. This is a diminutive of the word castrum, which means \\\"fortified place\\\". The Old English castel, French ch\\xC3\\xA2teau, Spanish castillo, Italian c\"\n- \"astello, as well as other European words for castle derive from castellum.[2] The word castle was introduced into English shortly before the Norman Conquest to \"\n- denote this type of building, then new to England, introduced to the country by Normans working for Edward the Confessor.[3] Although the various terms used for\n- \" castles in Europe derive from the same root, they are not universally applied to the same types of structures. The French ch\\xC3\\xA2teau is used to describe a grand \"\n- \"country house at the heart of an estate, regardless of the presence of fortifications.[4]\\n\\\n [edit] Defining characteristics\\n\\\n In its simplest terms, the definition \"\n- of a castle accepted amongst academics is \"a private fortified residence\".[5] This contrasts with earlier fortifications, such as Anglo Saxon burhs and walled c\n- \"ities such as Constantinople and Antioch in the Middle East: castles were not communal defences but were built and owned by the local feudal lord, either for th\"\n- emselves of for their monarch.[6] In the late 20th&#160;century, there was a trend to refine the definition of a castle by including the criterion of feudal own\n- ership, thus tying castles to the medieval period. However this does not necessarily reflect what medieval people called castles. During the First Crusade (1096\n- \"\\xE2\\x80\\x931099) the Frankish armies encountered walled settlements and forts that they indiscriminately called castles, but would not be considered such under the mode\"\n- |-\n rn definition.[5]\n \n \n \n \n Windsor Castle in England was first built as a fortification of the Norman Conquest, and today is home to Queen Elizabeth II of the United\n- \" Kingdom.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Castles served a range of purposes, the most important of which were military, administrative, and domestic. Early castles were primarily military i\"\n- \"nstitutions, places of protection from an enemy. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which could be used as a base of operations \"\n- in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England as both defensive and offensive tools to pacify the inhabitants.[7] As William the Co\n- nqueror advanced through England after the Norman Conquest in 1066, he fortifed key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087 he establis\n- hed 36&#160;castles such as Warwick Castle, which was used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.[8][9] However, a recent trend to view castles les\n- s as military institutions and more as social structures has questioned the current definition. During the Middle Ages, castles tended to lose their military si\n- |-\n gnificance and became more important as residences and statements of power.[10]\n In Britain the term \"castle\" has also been erroneously used to refer to Iron Age\n- \" fortifications such as Maiden Castle, Dorset.[11] A castle was not only a bastion and prison but also a place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers.\"\n- \" Over time the aesthetics of the design became more important, as the castle\'s appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant. Cast\"\n- les were built as defensive measures and offensive weapons, but comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls. Although castles still prov\n- |-\n ided protection from low levels of violence in later periods, eventually they were succeeded by country houses as high status residences.[12]\n [edit] Common feat\n- \"ures\\n\\\n [edit] Motte\\n\\\n Main article: Motte-and-bailey\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The wooden palisades surmounting mottes were often later replaced in stone, as in this example at Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau \"\n- |-\n de Gisors in France.\n \n \n A motte was a mound with a flat top. The mounds were often artificial, although sometimes they incorporated a pre-existing feature of the\n- \" landscape. The excavation of earth for the mound would leave a ditch around the motte, which acted as a further defence. Sometimes a nearby stream would be div\"\n- erted to flood the ditch, creating a moat. Motte and moat derive from the same Old French word, indicating that they were originally associated features and dep\n- \"ended on each other for their construction. Although the motte is usually associated with the bailey to form a motte-and-bailey castle, this was not always the \"\n- \"case and there are instances where a motte existed on its own. \\\"Motte\\\" refers to the mound alone, but it was often surmounted by a fortified structure, such as \"\n- a keep, and the flat top would be surrounded by a palisade.[13] The motte was accessed by a flying bridge as represented by the Bayeux Tapestry\'s depiction of C\n- \"h\\xC3\\xA2teau de Dinan.[14] Sometimes a motte covered an older castle or hall, whose rooms now became underground storage areas and prisons beneath a new donjon.[15]\\n\"\n- |-\n [edit] Bailey and enceinte\n Main article: Enceinte\n A bailey, also called a ward, was a fortified enclosure. They were a common feature of castles, and most had a\n- t least one. The keep on top of the motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home of t\n- \"he rest of the lord\'s household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities could all be expected to be \"\n- \"found in the bailey. There was a progression for lords to build more comfortable accommodation for themselves within the bailey, which resulted in the creation \"\n- of another bailey that separated the high status buildings such as the lord\'s chambers and the chapel, from the everyday structures such as the workshops and ba\n- rracks.[16] Although often associated with the motte-and-bailey type of castle, baileys could be found as independent defensive structures. These simple fortifi\n- cations were called ringworks.[17] The terms bailey and enceinte are linked, as the enceinte was the castle\'s main defensive enclosure. A castle could have seve\n- ral baileys but only one enceinte. Castles with no keep and which relied on their outer defences for protection are sometimes called enceinte castles;[18] these\n- \" were the earliest form of castles, before the donjon arrived in the 10th century.[19]\\n\\\n [edit] Keep\\n\\\n Main article: Keep\\n\\\n A keep was a great tower and usually the s\"\n- \"trongest point of a castle before the introduction of concentric defence. Keep was not a term used in the medieval period&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the term was applied from the\"\n- \" 16th&#160;century onwards&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and donjon was used to refer to great towers,[20] or turris in Latin. Dungeon is a corrupted form of donjon and means a dark\"\n- \", unwelcoming prison.[21] Although often the strongest part of a castle and a last place of refuge if the outer defences fell, the keep was not left empty in ca\"\n- se of attack but was used as a residence by the lord who owned the castle, or his guests or representatives.[22] Initially this was only the usual pattern in En\n- gland, when after the Norman Conquest of 1066 the \"conquerors lived for a long time in a constant state of alert\"; elsewhere the lord\'s wife presided over a sep\n- \"arate residence (domus, aula or mansio in Latin) close to the keep, and the donjon was a barracks and headquarters. Gradually the two functions merged into the \"\n- same building; for many examples choosing the appropriate term can be difficult, and the highest residential storeys have large windows.[23] In motte-and-bailey\n- \" castles, the keep was on top of the motte.[13]\\n\\\n [edit] Curtain wall\\n\\\n Main article: Curtain wall (fortification)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Carcassonne, France, showing the classic feat\"\n- |-\n ures of the curtain walls, defensive ditch with arched bridge, and cylindrical flanking towers, with a gatehouse and additional wooden defensive structures.\n \n \n C\n- \"urtain walls were defensive walls enclosing a bailey. They had to be high enough to make scaling the walls with ladders difficult and thick enough to withstand \"\n- bombardment from siege engines which from the 15th&#160;century onwards included artillery. A typical wall could be 3&#160;m (9.8&#160;ft) wide and 12&#160;m (3\n- \"9&#160;ft) tall, although sizes varied greatly between castles. To protect them from undermining, curtain walls were sometimes given a stone skirt around their \"\n- base. Walkways along the tops of the curtain walls allowed defenders to rain missiles on enemies from above, and battlements gave them further protection. Curta\n- in walls would be studded with towers to allow enfilading fire along the wall.[24] Arrow slits in the walls did not become common in Europe until the 13th&#160;\n- |-\n century, for fear that they might compromise the wall\'s strength.[25]\n [edit] Moat\n Main article: Moat\n A moat was a defensive ditch with steep sides, and could be\n- \" either water-filled or dry. Its purpose was to stop engines such as siege towers from reaching the curtain wall and to prevent the walls from being undermined.\"\n- \" Water moats are found in low lying areas. Moats were often crossed by a drawbridge, although these were often replaced by stone bridges. The moat around Flint \"\n- \"Castle in Wales needed 1,800&#160;excavators to build. Fortified islands could be added to the moat, adding another layer of defence. Water defences, including \"\n- moats as well as natural lakes, had the benefit of dictating the enemy\'s approach to the castle.[26] The 13th-century Caerphilly Castle, also in Wales, has some\n- \" of the largest water defences in Western Europe, on a site covering over 30&#160;acres (120,000&#160;m2), created by flooding the valley to the south of the ca\"\n- |-\n stle.[27]\n [edit] Gatehouse\n Main article: Gatehouse\n An undeveloped entrance is the weakest part in a circuit of defences. To overcome this, the gatehouse was dev\n- eloped, allowing those inside the castle to control the flow of traffic. In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in\n- \" stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot, so to allow the defenders to see the gate without exposing themselves projecting towers were added on each si\"\n- de of the gate, in a style similar to that developed by the Romans.[28] Contained within the building would be a series of defences to make a direct assault mor\n- \"e difficult than battering down a simple gate. There would be one or more portcullis&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 a wooden grille reinforced with metal to block a passage&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 \"\n- and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry an enemy. The passage through the gatehouse would have been lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant ha\n- \"d to spend being shot at in a confined space.[29] It is a popular myth that so-called murder-holes&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 openings in the roof of the gateway passge&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 \"\n- were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead, and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was completel\n- y impractical. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, similar to machicolations or to pour water to extinguish fires.[30] Provision was made i\n- n the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation, so the gate was never left undefended, although this evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of\n- \" defence.[31] The entrance to a castle could be further elaborated through the addition of a barbican. This consisted of a rampart and ditch in front of the gat\"\n- ehouse.[32] Developed in the 13th and 14th centuries,[33] it could also include a tower. The purpose of a barbican was not just to provide another line of defen\n- |-\n ce but to dictate the only approach to the gate.[34]\n [edit] Other features\n Battlements were most often found surmounting curtain walls, although also on the top\n- s of gatehouses, and comprised several elements; crenellations, hoardings and machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating\n- \" crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks on top of a wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at or\"\n- \" drop objects on attackers at the base of the wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Ma\"\n- chicolations were stone openings in the top of the wall that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base off the wall in a similar fashion to hoarding\n- s.[35] Arrowslits, also commonly called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts to be fired on attack\n- ers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but the size of the opening could also impede the defender if it w\n- \"as too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming.[36]\\n\\\n [edit] History\\n\\\n [edit] Antecedents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Ambleside Roman \"\n- |-\n fort, England\n \n \n Historian Charles Coulson states that the accumulation of wealth and resources such as food in ancient societies led to the need for defensive s\n- \"tructures. The earliest fortifications originate from the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. \"\n- \"Northern Europe was slower than the east to develop defensive structures and it was not until the Bronze Age that hill forts were developed, which proliferated \"\n- across Europe in the Iron Age. They differed to their eastern counterparts through the use of earthworks rather than stone as a building material.[37] Many eart\n- hworks survive today, along with evidence of palisades to accompany the ditches. In Europe, oppida emerged in the 2nd&#160;century BC; they were densely inhabit\n- ed fortified settlements, such as the oppidum of Manching, and developed from hill forts.[38] The Romans encountered fortified settlements such as hill forts an\n- \"d oppida when expanding their territory into northern Europe.[38] Although primitive, they were often effective, and required extensive siege engines and other \"\n- siege warfare techniques to overcome, such as at the Battle of Alesia. The Romans\' own fortifications (castra) varied from simple temporary earthworks thrown up\n- \" by armies on the move, to elaborate permanent stone constructions, notably the milecastles of Hadrian\'s Wall. Roman forts were generally rectangular with round\"\n- \"ed corners \\xE2\\x80\\x93 a \\\"playing-card shape\\\".[39]\\n\\\n [edit] Origins and early castles\\n\\\n Like the feudal society they were part of, castles had their origins in the 9th&#160\"\n- ;and 10th&#160;centuries. This period saw the emergence of a social and military elite in the Carolingian Empire and the development of mounted fighting. Fighti\n- ng on horseback was a costly and time consuming endeavour, requiring specialised equipment and trained horses, and for their efforts these early knights were gr\n- anted land by the lords for whom they fought. The link between knight and lord was the basis of feudalism, and could go higher up the social scale with loyaltie\n- s between lords, dukes, princes, and kings. When the Carolingian Empire collapsed in the 9th&#160;and 10th&#160;centuries, it took with it effective centralised\n- \" administration,[40] and it fell to the landed elite to take over control. This led to the privatisation of government, with local lords taking on the responsib\"\n- ility for the local economy and justice. Although castles were private buildings, lordship was a public office and the holder had a responsibility to protect hi\n- s peasants.[41] There is a traditional view that feudalism was a tool of social disintegration that contributed to the downfall of the Carolingian Empire, howev\n- er modern academic opinion is that it was a successor to previous government rather than a rival.[42] Castles sometimes required the permission of the king or o\n- ther high authority. Charles the Bald prohibited the construction of castles without his permission and ordered them destroyed; this could be the earliest refer\n- ence to castles being built without permission, breaking the feudal agreement between lord and vassal, however there are very few castles dated with certainty f\n- \"rom the mid-9th&#160;century. Converted into a donjon in around 950, Dou\\xC3\\xA9-la-Fontaine, in France, is the oldest standing castle in Europe.[43]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n One of the e\"\n- \"arliest representations of a castle from the Bayeux Tapestry. It depicts attackers of Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Dinan in France using fire, one of the threats to wooden castl\"\n- \"es.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Military historian Allen Brown asserts that in the absence of a working state and the breakdown of society associated with the decline of the Carolingian \"\n- \"Empire, feudal ties became more important. The rise of castles is not solely attributed to defence of the new feudal lords\\xE2\\x80\\x99 lands, but as a reaction to attack\"\n- s by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings.[40] It is likely that the castle evolved from the practice of fortifying a lordly home. In a time of social unrest, a lord w\n- \"ould wish to protect his home or hall, and the greatest threat was that of fire as they were usually wooden. To protect against this, and keep other threats at \"\n- \"bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an \"\n- artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers.[44] While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is an\n- cient, raising a motte to exploit the advantages of height is a medieval innovation.[45] A bank and ditch enclosure was a simple form of defence, and when found\n- \" without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enh\"\n- anced by the addition a stone curtain wall.[46] Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door.\n- \" This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 to make it harder to throw objects in&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and to change the entrance from ground floor to\"\n- \" first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls and contained the lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s household.[4\"\n- \"7] Castles were not just used as defensive sites, but to enhance a lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area,[4\"\n- |-\n 8] and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.[49]\n References to castles in texts such as charters from 1000 onwards i\n- ncreased greatly. Historians have interpreted this as evidence of a sudden increase in the number of castles in Europe around this time; their interpretation ha\n- s been supported by archaeologists dating the construction of castle sites through the examination of ceramics.[50] The increase in Italy began in the 950s, wit\n- h numbers of castles increasing by a factor of three to five every 50&#160;years, whereas other parts of Europe such as France and Spain were slower. In 950, Pr\n- ovence was home to 12&#160;castles, by 1000 this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100.[51] Despite the common period in which castles rose to pro\n- \"minence in Europe, their form and design varied from region to region. In the early 11th&#160;century, the motte&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 an artificial mound surmounted by a pa\"\n- \"lisade and tower&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was the most common form of castle in Europe, aside from Scandinavia.[51] Castles were introduced into England shortly before the Norm\"\n- \"an Conquest in 1066.[52] The motte and bailey&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 a motte with an outer enclosure&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 remained the dominant form of castle in England, Wales, and Irel\"\n- |-\n and well into the 12th&#160;century.[53] At the same time, castle architecture in mainland Europe became more sophisticated.[54]\n \n \n \n \n Built in 1138, Castle Risin\n- \"g in England is an example of an elaborate donjon.[55]\\n\\n\\n\\\n The donjon&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 or great tower[56]&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was at the centre of this change in castle architecture\"\n- \" in the 12th&#160;century. Central towers proliferated, and typically had a square plan, with walls 3 to 4&#160;m (9.8 to 13&#160;ft) thick. Their decoration em\"\n- ulated Romanesque architecture, and sometimes incorporated double windows similar to those found in church bell towers. Donjons, which were the residence of the\n- \" lord of the castle, evolved to become more spacious. The changes in design changed from utilitarian to decorative to impose upon the landscape as a symbol of l\"\n- ordly power, sometimes compromising defence for the sake of display.[54] Historians have interpreted the widespread presence of castles across Europe in the 11t\n- |-\n h&#160;and 12th&#160;centuries as evidence that warfare was common, and usually between local lords.[57]\n In some countries, it was necessary to obtain the permi\n- ssion of the king through a licence to crenellate, or else the builder risked it being slighted. This was not universal, as in some countries, the monarch had l\n- \"ittle control over lords, or required the construction of new castles to aid in securing the land&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 as was the case in England after 1066 and the Holy La\"\n- \"nd during the Crusades&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 so was unconcerned about granting permission. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built cast\"\n- les, and as a result there are 4,000 in the country. Before the 12th&#160;century, castles were as uncommon in Denmark as they had been in England before the No\n- |-\n rman Conquest. The introduction of castles to Denmark was a reaction to attacks from Wendish pirates, and they were usually intended as coastal defences.[58]\n [e\n- \"dit] Innovation and scientific design\\n\\\n Until the 12th century, stone-built and earth and timber castles were contemporary,[59] but by the late 12th&#160;century \"\n- the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly attributed to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of t\n- imber and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone.[60] Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork\n- \" castles were by no means useless.[61] This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; at the s\"\n- \"tart of the 15th&#160;century Owain Glynd\\xC5\\xB5r\\xE2\\x80\\x99s castle at Sycharth, founded in the late 11th&#160;century, was a timber structure.[62][63]\\n\\\n In the late 12th&#16\"\n- 0;century, there was an obvious change in castle architecture. Until then, castles probably had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrows\n- lits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the lay of the land, and the resu\n- lt was often irregular or curvilinear. The design of castles was of course not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the m\n- id-12th&#160;century.[64] By the end of the 12th&#160;century or the early 13th&#160;century, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in sh\n- ape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level t\n- o allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall. These later castles would not always have a keep, but this may have been because the more compl\n- \"ex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers provided space for habitation to make up for the \"\n- loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to t\n- \"he castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 although there was great variety in the styles of g\"\n- \"ateway and entrances&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and one or more portcullis.[65]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The gatehouse to the inner ward of Beeston Castle, England, was built in the 1220s and has an \"\n- |-\n entrance between two half-round towers.[66]\n \n \n When seeking to explain this change in the complexity and style of castles, antiquarians found their answer in the\n- \" Crusades. It seemed logical that the Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architectu\"\n- \"re. There were legends such as that of Lalys&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 an architect from Palestine who reputedly went to Wales after the Crusades and greatly enhanced the castle\"\n- \"s in the south of the country&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and it was assumed that great architects such as James of Saint George originated in the East. However, in the mid-20th&#\"\n- 160;century this view was cast into doubt. Legends were discredited, and in the case of James of Saint George, it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d\'E\n- \"sp\\xC3\\xA9ranche, in France. If the innovations in fortification had derived from the East, it would have been expected for their influence to be seen from 1100 onwar\"\n- \"ds, immediately after the Christians were victorious in the First Crusade (1096\\xE2\\x80\\x931099), rather than nearly 100&#160;years later.[67] Roman remains in western E\"\n- urope were still upstanding in many places, and as they too featured flanking round-towers, and entrances between two flanking towers. The castle builders of we\n- stern Europe were aware of and influenced by Roman design as demonstrated by the reuse of Saxon shore forts in England, a late Roman innovation despite their na\n- \"me, and in Spain the wall around the city of Avila imitated Roman architecture when it was built in 1091.[67] It has been argued&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 by historian Smail in \"\n- \"Crusading warfare&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 that the case for the influence of eastern fortification on the west has been overstated, and that crusaders of the 12th&#160;century\"\n- \" in fact learnt very little about scientific design from Byzantine and Saracen defences.[68] The explanation for this is that a well sited castle that made use \"\n- of natural defences and had strong ditches and walls had no need for a scientific design. An example of this approach is Karak Castle. Although there were no sc\n- \"ientific elements to its design it was almost impregnable, and in 1187 Saladin chose to lay siege to the castle and starve out its garrison rather than risk an \"\n- |-\n assault.[68]\n After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did not return to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the principality of Antioch, the\n- \" County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their acquisitions were designed mostly by Syrian mas\"\n- \"ter-masons. Their design was very similar to a Roman fort or Byzantine tetrapyrgia: a square curtain wall with towers in each corner, also usually square and no\"\n- t projecting much beyond the curtain wall. In the interior, the keep would have had a square plan and generally be undecorated.[69] While castles were used to h\n- \"old a site and control movement of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified.[70] Castle architecture in the East became more \"\n- \"complex around the late 12th and early 13th&#160;century after the stalemate of the Third Crusade (1189\\xE2\\x80\\x931192). Both Christians and Muslims created fortificati\"\n- ons, and the character of each was different. Saphadin, the 13th-century ruler of the Saracens, created structures with large rectangular towers that influenced\n- \" Muslim architecture and were copied again and again, however they had little influence on Crusader castles.[71]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Krak des Chevaliers is a concentric castle \"\n- \"built with both rectangular and rounded towers. It is amongst the best preserved Crusader castles.[72]\\n\\n\\n\\\n In the early 13th&#160;century, Crusaders castles were \"\n- mostly built by Military Orders, such as the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Knights of the Teutonic Order. They were responsible for the foundation o\n- f sites such as Krak des Chevaliers, Margat, and Belvoir. The forms of the castle varied not just between orders, but individually from castle to castle, althou\n- gh it was common for the castles founded in this period to have concentric defences.[73] The concept, which originated in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, w\n- as to remove the reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be more than one ring of defensive wall, one i\n- nside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If an assailant made it past the first line o\n- \"f defences into the outer enclosure, they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall to secure \"\n- \"the fall of the castle.[74] Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe, for instance when Edward I of England&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 who had himself been on Crusade&\"\n- \"#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 built castles in Wales in the late 13th&#160;century, four of the eight he founded were concentric.[73][74] Not all the features of the Crusader castle\"\n- s from the 13th &amp;nbspcentury were emulated in Europe; for instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the entrance in the side of a tower and for th\n- ere to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this feature to be found in Europe.\n- |-\n [73]\n It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels; something that contemporary builders in Europe were wary o\n- f, believing that they weakened the wall\'s structural integrity. Arrowslits did not compromise the wall\'s strength, but it was not until Edward I\'s programme of\n- \" castle building that they were adopted in Europe.[25] The Crusades also led to the introduction of machicolations into western architecture. Until the 13th&#16\"\n- 0;century, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed\n- \" the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the \"\n- |-\n East long before the arrival of the Crusades, and perhaps as early as the first half of the 8th&#160;century in Syria.[75]\n Although France has been described as\n- \" \\\"the heartland of medieval architecture\\\", the English were at the forefront of castle architecture in the 12th&#160;century. French historian Francois Gebelin \"\n- said:[76] \"The great revival in military architecture was led, as one would naturally expect, by the powerful kings and princes of the time; by the sons of Will\n- iam the Conqueror and their descendants, the Plantagenets, when they became dukes of Normandy. These were the men who built all the most typical twelfth-century\n- \" fortified castles remaining to-day\\\".[77] Despite this, by the beginning of the 15th&#160;century, the rate of castle construction in England and Wales went int\"\n- o decline; the new castles were generally of a lighter build than earlier structures and presented few innovations, although strong sites were still created suc\n- h as that of Raglan in Wales. At the same time, French castle architecture came to the fore and led the way in the field of medieval fortifications. Across Euro\n- \"pe&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 particularly the Baltic, Germany, and Scotland&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 castles were built well into the 16th&#160;century.[78]\\n\\\n [edit] Advent of gunpowder\\n\\\n Artillery\"\n- \" powered by gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns are not recorded until the 1380s and were unpredictable and inaccurate \"\n- \"weapons.[79] Castles were adapted to allow small guns&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 averaging between 19.6 and 22&#160;kg (43 and 49&#160;lb)&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 to fire from towers. These gun\"\n- s were too heavy for a man to carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle on the edge of the gun port he could fire the weapon. The g\n- \"un ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the \"\n- \"timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there \"\n- is an intact example at in Doornenburg Castle in Denmark. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on t\n- |-\n op to allow the gunner to aim.[80]\n \n \n \n \n The rounded walls of Sarzana Castle in Italy are adaptated to gunpowder.\n \n \n This form is very common in castles adapted fo\n- \"r guns, found in Egypt, Italy, Scotland, and Spain, and elsewhere in between. Other types of port, though less common were horizontal slits&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 allowing on\"\n- \"ly lateral movement&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and large square openings, which allowed greater movement.[80] The use of guns for defence gave rise to artillery castles, such as \"\n- \"that of Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Ham in France, Defences against guns was not developed until a later stage.[81] Ham is an example of the trend for new castles to dispense w\"\n- \"ith earlier features such as machicolations, tall towers, and crenellations.[82]\\n\\\n Bigger guns were developed, and in the 15th&#160;century became an alternative \"\n- \"to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages before the advent\"\n- \" of gunpowder&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 were those of a greater range and greater power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made bigger and bigger. By the 1450s\"\n- \" guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mohammed II at the Siege of Constantinople.[83] The response towards more eff\"\n- ective cannons was to build thicker walls than in previous castles and to prefer round towers as the curving sides were more likely to deflect a shot than a fla\n- \"t surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures had to find a way to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled \"\n- behind a castle\'s curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.[84] Often, castles constructed before the age of gunpowder would be incapable of using gun\n- s as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface fo\n- r the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which\n- \" avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle\'s defences. These could be built from earthier earth or stone and were used to mount w\"\n- |-\n eapons.[85]\n Around 1500, the innovation of the angled bastion over curved was developed in Italy.[86] The elite who were responsible for castle construction wer\n- e forced to choose between the new type which could withstand cannon-fire but as a result was ugly and uncomfortable to live in, or to stick with an earlier mor\n- e elaborate style with had more aesthetic appeal and was more of a status symbol. The second choice was more popular, and while the castle retained its use as a\n- \" status symbol, it became apparent that earlier fortifications were unable to stand up to cannons, and so there was no point in trying to make the site genuinel\"\n- |-\n y defensible.[87]\n \n \n \n \n Fortaleza Ozama in the Dominican Republic was the first castle built in the Americas\n \n \n However, some true castles were built in the Americ\n- \"as by the Spanish, English, and French colonies. The first stage of Spanish fort construction has been termed the \\\"castle period\\\", which lasted from 1492 until \"\n- the end of the 16th&#160;century.[88] Starting with Fortaleza Ozama, \"these castles were essentially European medieval castles transposed to America.\"[89] Among\n- \" other defensive structures (including forts and citadels), castles were also built in New France towards the end of the 17th&#160;century.[89] Where artillery \"\n- \"was not as developed as on the battle-fields of Europe, some of Montreal\'s outlying forts were built like the fortified manor houses of France. Fort Longueuil, \"\n- \"built from 1695\\xE2\\x80\\x931698 by a baronial family, has been described as \\\"the most medieval-looking fort built in Canada\\\".[90] The manor house and stables were within\"\n- \" a fortified bailey, with a tall round turret in each corner. The \\\"most substantial castle-like fort\\\" near Montr\\xC3\\xA9al was Fort Senneville, built in 1692 with squ\"\n- are towers connected by thick stone walls, as well as a fortified windmill.[91] Stone forts such as these served as defensive residences, as well as imposing st\n- |-\n ructures to prevent Iroquois incursions.[92]\n Although castle construction faded towards the 16th&#160;century, they did not necessarily all fall out of use. Som\n- e retained some role in local administration and became law courts, while others are still handed down in aristocratic families as hereditary seats. A particula\n- rly famous example of this is Windsor Castle in England which was founded in the 11th&#160;century and is home to the monarch of the United Kingdom.[93] In othe\n- r cases they still had a role in defence. Tower houses, which are closely related to castles and include pele towers, were defended towers that were permanent r\n- esidences built in the 14th to 17th centuries. Especially common in Ireland and Scotland, they could be up to five storeys high and succeeded common enclosure c\n- \"astles and were built by a greater social range of people. While unlikely to provide as much protection as a more complex castle, they offered security against \"\n- |-\n raiders and other small threats.[94][95]\n [edit] Later use and revival castles\n According to archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham, \"the great country\n- \" houses of the seventeenth to twentieth centuries were, in a social sense, the castles of their day\\\".[96] Although there was a trend for the elite to move from \"\n- \"castles into country houses in the 17th&#160;century, castles were not completely useless. In later conflicts, such as the English Civil War (1641\\xE2\\x80\\x931651), many\"\n- \" castles were refortified, although subsequently slighted to prevent them from being used again.[97]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Neuschwanstein is a 19th-century neo-romantic castle bu\"\n- |-\n ilt by Ludwig II of Bavaria.\n \n \n Artificial ruins became popular in the 18th&#160;century as a manifestation of a romantic interest in the Middle Ages and chivalr\n- y, and as part of the broader Gothic Revival in architecture. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar,\n- \" although differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on el\"\n- ements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but they served no military purpose and were solely for display.[98] Revival or mock castles, mos\n- t of which were country houses, were particularly common in the British Isles, for example Belvoir Castle and Eastnor Castle in England and Castell Coch in Wale\n- \"s.[99] Edwin Lutyens\' Castle Drogo (1911\\xE2\\x80\\x931930) was the last flicker of this movement in England.[100] In Mexico, Chapultepec Castle, a former military strongh\"\n- old, used as the imperial residence of the monarchs of the Second Mexican Empire, was created in the Neo-Classical and Neo-Gothic styles.[101] Also, the 19th-ce\n- |-\n ntury Neuschwanstein is one such revival castle in Germany.[102]\n [edit] Construction\n See also: Medieval technology&#160;and Stonemasonry\n \n \n \n \n Construction of a l\n- |-\n arge tower, with scaffolding and masons at work. The holes mark the position of the scaffolding in earlier stages of construction.\n \n \n Once the site of a castle h\n- \"ad been selected&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 whether a strategic position or one intended to dominate the landscape as a mark of power&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the building material had to be sel\"\n- \"ected. An earth and timber castle was cheaper and easier to erect than one built from stone. The costs involved in construction are not well recorded, and most \"\n- surviving records relate to royal castles.[103] A castle with earthen ramparts, a motte, and timber defences and buildings could have been constructed by an uns\n- killed workforce. The source of man-power was probably from the local lordship, and the tenants would already have the necessary skills of felling trees, diggin\n- g, and working timber necessary for an earth and timber castle. Possibly coerced into working for their lord, the construction of an earth and timber castle wou\n- \"ld not have been a drain on a client\\xE2\\x80\\x99s funds. In terms of time, it has been estimated that an average sized motte&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 5&#160;m (16&#160;ft) high and 15&#\"\n- \"160;m (49&#160;ft) wide at the summit&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 would have taken 50&#160;people about 40&#160;working days. An exceptionally expensive motte and bailey was that \"\n- \"of Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 for \\xC2\\xA320. The high cost, relative to other castles of its type, was because labourers had to be imported.[103]\\n\\\n Although thei\"\n- r cost varied according to factors such as their complexity and transport costs for material, it is certain that stone castles cost a great deal more than those\n- \" built from earth and timber. Even a very small tower, such as Peveril Castle, would have cost around \\xC2\\xA3200. In the middle were castles such as Orford, which wa\"\n- \"s built in the late 12th&#160;century for \\xC2\\xA31,400, and at the upper end were those such as Dover, which cost about \\xC2\\xA37,000 between 1112 and 1191.[104] Spending \"\n- \"on the scale of the vast castles such as Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau Gaillard (an estimated \\xC2\\xA315,000 to \\xC2\\xA320,000 between 1196 and 1198) was easily supported by The Crown, but for \"\n- \"lords of smaller areas, castle building was a very serious and costly undertaking. It was usual for a stone castle to take the best part of a decade to finish. \"\n- \"The cost of a large castle built over this time (anywhere from \\xC2\\xA31,000 to \\xC2\\xA310,000) would take the income from several manors, severely impacting on a lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s \"\n- \"finances.[105] Cost in the late 13th&#160;century were of a similar order, with castles such as Beaumaris and Rhuddlan costing \\xC2\\xA314,500 and \\xC2\\xA39,000 respectively\"\n- \". Edward I\\xE2\\x80\\x99s campaign of castle-building in Wales cost \\xC2\\xA380,000 between 1277 and 1304, and \\xC2\\xA395,000 between 1277 and 1329.[106] Renowned designer Master James\"\n- \" of Saint George, responsible for the construction of Beaumaris, explained the cost:\\n\\n\\\n In case you should wonder where so much money could go in a week, we would\"\n- \" have you know that we have needed&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and shall continue to need 400 masons, both cutters and layers, together with 2,000 less skilled workmen, 100&#160;c\"\n- arts, 60&#160;wagons and 30&#160;boats bringing stone and sea coal; 200&#160;quarrymen; 30&#160;smiths; and carpenters for putting in the joists and floor board\n- s and other necessary jobs. All this takes no account of the garrison&#160;... nor of purchases of material. Of which there will have to be a great quantity&#16\n- \"0;... The men\\xE2\\x80\\x99s pay has been and still is very much in arrears, and we are having the greatest difficulty in keeping them because they have simply nothing to \"\n- |-\n live on.[107]\n \n Not only were stone castles expensive to build in the first place, but their maintenance was a constant drain. They contained a lot of timber, wh\n- \"ich was often unseasoned and as a result needed careful upkeep. Castles such as Exeter and Gloucester were often given figures of between \\xC2\\xA320 and \\xC2\\xA350 annually\"\n- \" in the late 12th&#160;century for constant repairs.[108]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The Castle of the Teutonic Order in Malbork, Poland, is an example of brick-built castle and was b\"\n- \"uilt in a style different to that of castles in western Europe and the Near East.[109]\\n\\n\\n\\\n Medieval machines and inventions, such as the treadwheel crane, became \"\n- indispensable during construction, and techniques of building wooden scaffolding were improved upon from Antiquity.[110] Finding stone for shell keeps and castl\n- \"e walls was the first concern of medieval builders, and a major preoccupation was to have quarries close at hand.[111] There are examples of some castles where \"\n- \"stone was quarried on site, such as Chinon, Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Coucy and Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau Gaillard.[111]\\n\\\n Brick-built structures were not necessarily weaker than their stone-bu\"\n- ilt counterparts. In England, brick production proliferated along the south-east coast due to an influx of Flemish weavers and a reduction in the amount of avai\n- lable, leading to a demand for an alternative building material. Brick castles are less common than stone or earth and timber constructions, and often it was ch\n- \"osen for its aesthetic appeal or because it was in fashion, encouraged by the brick architecture of the Low Countries. For example, when Tattershall Castle was \"\n- built between 1430 and 1450, there was plenty of stone available nearby, however the owner, Lord Cromwell, chose to use brick. About 700,000 bricks were used to\n- \" built the castle, which has been described as \\xE2\\x80\\x9Cthe finest piece of medieval brick-work in England\\xE2\\x80\\x9D.[112] Brick castles were predominant in Scandinavia and \"\n- |-\n the Baltic;[113] Denmark had few quarries, and as a result, most of its castles are earth and timber affairs, or later on built from brick.[114]\n [edit] Social c\n- |\n entre\n Main article: Court (royal)\n \n \n \n \n God Speed! by Edmund Blair Leighton, 1900: a late Victorian view of a lady giving a favour to a knight about to do battle\n\n- \"\\n\\n\\\n Due to the lord\'s presence in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as \"\n- \"without the support of his more powerful tennants, a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately \"\n- below them on the social scale, but absentee lords found their power weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit a\n- ll his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.[115] To allow the l\n- ord to concentrate on his duties regarding administration, he had a household of servants to take care of chores such as providing food. The household was run b\n- y a chamberlain, while a treasurer took care of the estate\'s written records. Royal households took essentially the same form as baronial households, although o\n- n a much larger scale and the positions were more prestigious.[116] Without the presence of a lord\'s household, usually because he was staying elsewhere, a cast\n- le would have been a quiet place with few residents, focused on maintaining the castle.[117] Not just a utilitarian structure, as social centres castles were al\n- \"so important places for display. Builders took the opportunity to draw on symbolism to evoke a sense of chivalry that was aspired to in the Middle Ages amongst \"\n- \"the elite. Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features.[118] The \"\n- \"right to crenelate, when granted by a monarch&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 though it was not always necessary&amp;bsp;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was important not just as it allowed a lord to defend his \"\n- \"property but because crenelations and other accoutrements associated with castles were prestigious through their use by the elite.[119]\\n\\\n The purpose of marriage \"\n- \"between the medieval elites was to secure land, not for love; girls were married in their teens, but boys did not marry until they came of age.[120] There is a \"\n- popular conception that women played a peripheral role in the medieval castle household, and that it was dominated by the lord himself. This derives from the im\n- age of the castle as a martial institution, but most castles in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never involved in conflicts or sieges, so the domest\n- \"ic life is a neglected facet.[121] The lady was given a \\\"marriage portion\\\" of her husband\'s estates&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 usually about a third&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 which were hers for \"\n- life, and her husband would inherit on her death; it was her duty to administer them directly, as the lord administered his own land.[122] Despite generally bei\n- ng excluded from military service, a woman could be in charge of a castle, either on behalf of her lordly husband or if she was widowed. Because of their influe\n- nce within the medieval household women influenced construction and design, sometimes through direct patronage; historian Charles Coulson emphasises the role of\n- \" women in applying \\\"a refined aristocratic taste\\\" to castles due to their long term residence.[123] Courtly love was the eroticisation of love between the nobil\"\n- \"ity. Emphasis was placed on restraint between lovers. It was sometimes in private and was expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments. The legend of \"\n- Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages.[124] It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other,\n- \" although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 Henry I of England had over 20&#160;bast\"\n- \"ards for instance&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.[125]\\n\\\n [edit] Castle landscapes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The approach to Kenilworth Castle, Engl\"\n- |-\n and, was lengthened to form a winding route through a moat and an artificial water landscape.\n \n \n As castles were not simply military buildings but centres of adm\n- inistration and symbols of power, they had a significant impact on the landscape around them. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems d\n- \"ue to their role in managing the lord\'s estate,[126] which gave them greater influence over resources.[127] Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer \"\n- parks and were important in their maintenance. Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, and many were found next to castles. Not only were they practical i\n- |-\n n that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.[128]\n Although sometimes the const\n- \"ruction of a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it is more common for the villages nearby to have grown as a result \"\n- of the presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle.[126] The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confi\n- ned to Europe; when Safad Castle was founded in Galilee, in the Holy Land, during the 13th&#160;century, the nearby town benefited from its presence as people c\n- ould now move freely in the area and the 260&#160;villages locally became profitable.[129] When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local l\n- andscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord.[130] Settlements grew naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of p\n- roximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importa\n- \"nce&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement dep\"\n- |-\n opulated.[131]\n During and shortly after the Norman Conquest of England, castles were inserted into important pre-existing towns to control and subdue the popula\n- ce. They were usually location with reference to any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structur\n- es occupying the desired site. In Lincoln, 166&#160;houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a m\n- oat for the castle. As the military importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and the\n- ir financial and judicial roles.[132] When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11th&#160;and 12th&#160;centuries, settlement in those countr\n- |-\n ies was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns is often linked with the creation of a castle.[133]\n Symbolism in relation to castles and their sett\n- ing was very important, as demonstrated by the proximity of high status features such as fish ponds. Also often found near to a castle, sometimes within its def\n- ences, was the parish church.[134] This has been interpreted as a relationship between the church and feudal lords, where the lords patronised the church, which\n- \" was one of the most important institutions of medieval society.[135] Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military can be\"\n- \" highly symbolic. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 comprising a moat and several satellite ponds&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 forced anyone approaching t\"\n- he castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway.[136] Another example is that of the\n- \" 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advance castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and t\"\n- he moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site look more impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer a\n- round the castle, ensuring they got a good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.[137] This also dem\n- onstrates that licenses to crenellate were not solely about a desire to defend oneself, but to have proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who\n- \" was the one responsible for granting permission.[138]\\n\\\n [edit] Warfare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n A trebuchet at Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau des Baux in France\\n\\n\\n\\\n As a static structure, castles could ofte\"\n- n be avoided as their immediate area of influence was about 400&#160;metres (1,300&#160;ft) and their weapons had a short range even early in the age of artille\n- ry. Although leaving an enemy behind the army would allow them to interfere with communications and make raids in the landscape to harry the army. Garrisons wer\n- e expensive, and as a result often small unless the castle was important.[139] Garrisons were smaller in peace time due to the cost of upkeep, and small castles\n- \" were manned by perhaps a couple of watchmen and gate-guards. Even in war garrisons were not necessarily large as too large a defending force would impair the c\"\n- \"astles ability to withstand a long siege; in 1403 a force of 37&#160;archers successfully defended Caernarfon Castle against two assaults by Owain Glynd\\xC5\\xB5r\'s al\"\n- lies during a long siege.[140] Early on, manning a castle was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later re\n- \"placed with paid forces.[140][141] If it was necessary to control the castle for strategic reasons, an army could lay siege to it and starve the defenders out. \"\n- \"Without relief from an outside source, the defending army would eventually submit, but sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies \"\n- of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later.[142] For th\n- e most heavily fortified sites it was more efficient to starve the garrison out that to assault it. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also a\n- \"pplied to the fortified towns of the day.[143] On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally.[144]\\n\\\n If forced to assault \"\n- \"a castle, there were many options available to the attackers. For wooden structures, such as early motte-and-baileys, fire was a real threat and attempts would \"\n- \"be made to set them on fire.[143] Project weapons had been used since antiquity and the mangonel and petraria&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 from Roman and Oriental origins respectiv\"\n- \"ely&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 were the main two that were used into the Middle Ages. The trebuchet, probably evolved from the petraria in the 13th&#160;century, was the most eff\"\n- \"ective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. \"\n- Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high trajectory of its projectile, and would be protected from direct fi\n- re by the curtain walls.[145] Eventually cannons developed to the point where they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the\n- \" main weapon in siege warfare.[83] Walls could be undermined by the creation of a sap; a mine would be dug to conceal the attackers approach to the wall, with w\"\n- ooden supports to prevent the tunnel from collapsing. When the target had been reached, the supports would be burned, caving in the tunnel and bringing down the\n- \" structure above.[146] Battering rams were also used, usually in the form of a tree trunk given an iron cap. They were used to batter down the castle gates, alt\"\n- \"hough they were sometimes used against walls, but with less effect.[147] As an alternative to creating a breach in the walls, an escalade could be attempted to \"\n- capture the walls, with fighting along the walkways on the curtain walls;[148] in this instance, attackers would be very vulnerable to arrowfire, particularly f\n- \"rom crossbows or the English longbow.[149]\\n\\\n [edit] See also\\n\\n\\\n Alc\\xC3\\xA1zar (Spanish castles)\\n\\\n Shiro (Japanese fortifications)\\n\\n\\\n [edit] References\\n\\n\\\n Notes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2\"\n- |\n 005, pp.&#160;7, 10.\n ^ Creighton &amp; Higham 2003, p.&#160;6.\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;32.\n ^ Allen Brown 2004, p.&#160;1.\n ^ a b Coulson 2003, p.&#160;16.\n\n- \"^ Liddiard 2005, pp.&#160;15\\xE2\\x80\\x9317.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;47.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, p.&#160;18.\\n\\\n ^ Stephens 1969, pp.&#160;452\\xE2\\x80\\x93475.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, pp.&#160;2, 6\\xE2\\x80\\x93\"\n- \"7.\\n\\\n ^ Creighton &amp; Higham 2003, pp.&#160;6\\xE2\\x80\\x937.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, p.&#160;2.\\n\\\n ^ a b Friar 2003, p.&#160;214.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;55.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Bar\"\n- \"th\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 397\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;22.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, pp.&#160;214, 216.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;105.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Barth\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 399\\n\\\n ^\"\n- \" Friar 2003, p.&#160;163.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;188.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;190.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Barth\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 402-6.

Typicall\n- |-\n y, costs are borne in the majority by government-funded programs.\n Universal health care systems vary according to the extent of government involvement in provid\n- ing care and/or health insurance. In some countries, such as the UK, Spain, and the Nordic countries, the government has a high degree of involvement in the com\n- missioning or delivery of health care services and access is based on residence rights not on the purchase of insurance. Others have a much more pluralistic del\n- ivery system based on obligatory health with contributory insurance rates related to salaries or income, and usually funded by employers and beneficiaries joint\n- ly. Sometimes the health funds are derived from a mixture of insurance premiums and government taxes. These insurance based systems tend to have a higher propor\n- \"tion of private medical providers obtaining reimbursement, often at heavily regulated rates, through mutual or publicly owned medical insurers. A few countries \"\n- such as the Netherlands and Switzerland operate via privately owned but heavily regulated private insurers. Americans use the term \"single-payer health care\" to\n- \" describe the pooling of health care funds into a single not-for-profit fund for a region or nation. The term is frequently ascribed to the Canadian health care\"\n- \" system.\\n\\\n Universal health care is implemented in all industrialized countries, with the exception of the United States.[1] It is also provided in many developin\"\n- |-\n g countries.\n \n \n \n \n Contents\n \n \n 1 History\n 2 Implementation and Comparisons\n \n 2.1 Americas\n \n 2.1.1 Brazil\n 2.1.2 Canada\n 2.1.3 Colombia\n 2.1.4 Mexico\n 2.1.5 Peru\n 2.1.6 Tri\n- |-\n nidad and Tobago\n 2.1.7 United States\n \n \n 2.2 Asia\n \n 2.2.1 Bhutan\n 2.2.2 People\'s Republic of China\n \n 2.2.2.1 Hong Kong SAR\n \n \n 2.2.3 India\n 2.2.4 Israel\n 2.2.5 Singapore\n- |-\n \n 2.2.6 Taiwan (Republic of China)\n 2.2.7 Thailand\n \n \n 2.3 Europe\n \n 2.3.1 Austria\n 2.3.2 Finland\n 2.3.3 Germany\n 2.3.4 Ireland\n 2.3.5 Netherlands\n 2.3.6 United Kingdom\n \n 2\n- |-\n .3.6.1 England\n 2.3.6.2 Northern Ireland\n 2.3.6.3 Scotland\n 2.3.6.4 Wales\n \n \n \n \n 2.4 Oceania\n \n 2.4.1 Australia\n 2.4.2 New Zealand\n \n \n \n \n 3 Economics\n \n 3.1 Funding models\n \n 3\n- |-\n .1.1 Single-payer\n 3.1.2 Public\n 3.1.3 Compulsory insurance\n 3.1.4 Private insurance\n \n \n \n \n 4 See also\n 5 References\n 6 External links\n \n \n \n \n \n //<![CDATA[\n if (window.showT\n- |-\n ocToggle) { var tocShowText = \"show\"; var tocHideText = \"hide\"; showTocToggle(); } \n //]]>\n \n [edit] History\n Germany has the world\'s oldest universal health care s\n- ystem, with origins dating back to Otto von Bismarck\'s social legislation, which included the Health Insurance Bill of 1883, Accident Insurance Bill of 1884, an\n- d Old Age and Disability Insurance Bill of 1889. In Britain, the National Insurance Act 1911 marked the first steps there towards universal health care, coverin\n- g most employed persons and their financial dependents and all persons who had been continuous contributors to the scheme for at least five years whether they w\n- ere working or not. This system of health insurance continued in force until the creation of the National Health Service in 1948 which extended health care secu\n- rity to all legal residents. Most current universal health care systems were implemented in the period following the Second World War as a process of deliberate\n- \" healthcare reform, intended to make health care available to all, in the spirit of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, signed by e\"\n- |-\n very country doing so. The US did not ratify the social and economic rights sections, including Article 25\'s right to health.[2]\n [edit] Implementation and Compa\n- |-\n risons\n See also: Health care system\n Universal health care is a broad concept that has been implemented in several ways. The common denominator for all such prog\n- rams is some form of government action aimed at extending access to health care as widely as possible and setting minimum standards. Most implement universal he\n- alth care through legislation, regulation and taxation. Legislation and regulation direct what care must be provided, to whom, and on what basis. Usually some c\n- osts are borne by the patient at the time of consumption but the bulk of costs come from a combination of compulsory insurance and tax revenues. Some programs a\n- re paid for entirely out of tax revenues. In others tax revenues are used either to fund insurance for the very poor or for those needing long term chronic care\n- \". The UK government\'s National Audit Office in 2003 published an international comparison of ten different health care systems in ten developed countries, nine \"\n- universal systems against one non-universal system (the U.S.), and their relative costs and key health outcomes.[3] A wider international comparison of 16 count\n- ries, each with universal health care, was published by the World Health Organization in 2004 [4] In some cases, government involvement also includes directly m\n- |-\n anaging the health care system, but many countries use mixed public-private systems to deliver universal health care.\n [edit] Americas\n Argentina, Brazil (see bel\n- ow), Canada (see below), Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico (see below), Panama, Peru (see below), Uruguay, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela all have public unive\n- |-\n rsal health care provided.\n [edit] Brazil\n Main article: Health care in Brazil\n The universal health care system was adopted in Brazil in 1988 after the end of the\n- \" military regime\'s rule.\\n\\\n [edit] Canada\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in Canada\\n\\\n In 1984, the Canada Health Act was passed, which prohibited extra billing by doctors \"\n- on patients while at the same time billing the public insurance system. In 1999, the prime minister and most premiers reaffirmed in the Social Union Framework A\n- \"greement that they are committed to health care that has \\\"comprehensiveness, universality, portability, public administration and accessibility.\\\"[5]\\n\\\n The system \"\n- \"is for the most part publicly funded, yet most of the services are provided by private enterprises or private corporations, although most hospitals are public. \"\n- Most doctors do not receive an annual salary, but receive a fee per visit or service.[6] About 29% of Canadians\' health care is paid for by the private sector o\n- \"r individuals.[7] This mostly goes towards services not covered or only partially covered by Medicare such as prescription drugs, dentistry and vision care.[8] \"\n- \"Many Canadians have private health insurance, often through their employers, that cover these expenses.[9]\\n\\\n The Canada Health Act of 1984 \\\"does not directly bar \"\n- private delivery or private insurance for publicly insured services,\" but provides financial disincentives for doing so. \"Although there are laws prohibiting or\n- \" curtailing private health care in some provinces, they can be changed,\\\" according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.[10][11] The legality of t\"\n- he ban was considered in a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada which ruled in Chaoulli v. Quebec that \"the prohibition on obtaining private health insurance\n- \", while it might be constitutional in circumstances where health care services are reasonable as to both quality and timeliness, is not constitutional where the\"\n- \" public system fails to deliver reasonable services.\\\" The appellant contended that waiting times in Quebec violated a right to life and security in the Quebec C\"\n- harter of Human Rights and Freedoms. The Court agreed, but acknowledged the importance and validity of the Canada Health Act, and at least four of the seven jud\n- \"ges explicitly recognized the right of governments to enact laws and policies which favour the public over the private system and preserve the integrity of the \"\n- |-\n public system.\n [edit] Colombia\n Main article: Health in Colombia\n In 1993 a reform transformed the health care system in Colombia, trying to provide a better, sus\n- |-\n tainable, health care system and to reach every Colombian citizen.\n [edit] Mexico\n Further information: Health care in Mexico\n On December 1, 2006 the Mexican gove\n- \"rnment created the Health Insurance for a New Generation also known as \\\"life insurance for babies\\\".[12][13][14]\\n\\\n On May 28, 2009 Mexico announced Universal Care \"\n- |-\n Coverage for Pregnant Women.[15]\n [edit] Peru\n On April 9, 2009 the Government of Peru published the Law on Health Insurance to enable all Peruvians to access qua\n- lity health services, and contribute to regulate the financing and supervision of these services. The law enables all population to access diverse health servic\n- \"es to prevent illnesses, and promote and rehabilitate people, under a Health Basic Plan (PEAS).[16][17]\\n\\\n [edit] Trinidad and Tobago\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in \"\n- \"Trinidad and Tobago\\n\\\n The universal health care system is used in Trinidad and Tobago and is the primary form of health-care available in the country.

According to the Institute of Medicine of the National A\n- \"cademies of Science, this unfunded \\xE2\\x80\\x9Csafety net\\xE2\\x80\\x9D mandate has contributed to increasing strain on the health system. Emergency treatment is not free or subsid\"\n- ized and some patients cannot or will not pay their bills. Furthermore, this system encourages use of the emergency facilities for primary care and not just for\n- \" emergency purposes.[18]\\n\\\n In lieu of a national program, some states and municipalities have made attempts to approach universality of insurance in their respect\"\n- ive jurisdictions. The state of Massachusetts implemented a near-universal health care system by mandating that residents purchase health insurance by July 1, 2\n- 007.[19] The City of San Francisco is also undertaking a universal health care system for uninsured residents.[20][21] Hawaii has, since 1974, required employer\n- s to provide employees working more than 20 hours per week with a comprehensive health insurance plan.[22] California, Maine and Vermont are also considering or\n- \" seeking to implement universal or near-universal systems.[23] In July, 2009, Connecticut passed into law a plan called SustiNet, with the goal of achieving nea\"\n- |-\n r-universal healthcare coverage by 2014.[24]\n Whether a federal system of universal health care should be implemented in the US remains a hotly debated political\n- \" topic, with Americans divided in their views.\\n\\\n [edit] Asia\\n\\\n Bhutan, Brunei, China,[25] Hong Kong SAR, India[citation needed], Kuwait[citation needed], Qatar[cita\"\n- tion needed], UAE[citation needed], Saudi Arabia[citation needed], Israel,[26] Japan, Malaysia[citation needed], South Korea, Seychelles[citation needed], Sri L\n- |-\n anka,[27] Taiwan,[28], Pakistan[citation needed] and Thailand[citation needed] have universal health care.\n [edit] Bhutan\n Main article: Health in Bhutan\n The Roya\n- \"l Government of Bhutan maintains a policy of free and universal access to primary health care. As hospital facilities in the country are limited, patients with \"\n- diseases that cannot be treated in Bhutan, such as cancer, are normally referred to hospitals in India for treatment. Such referral treatment is also carried ou\n- \"t at the cost of the Royal Government.[29]\\n\\\n [edit] People\'s Republic of China\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare system reform in the People\'s Republic of China\\n\\\n Since the \"\n- \"founding of the People\'s Republic of China, the goal of health care programs has been to provide care to every member of the population and to make maximum use \"\n- |-\n of limited health-care personnel, equipment, and financial resources.[citation needed]\n China is undertaking a reform on its health care system, which was largel\n- y privatized in the 1990s. The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS), is a new 2005 initiative to overhaul the healthcare system, particularly int\n- ended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, the annual cost of medical cover is 50 yuan (US$7) per person. Of that, 20 yuan is paid i\n- \"n by the central government, 20 yuan by the provincial government and a contribution of 10 yuan is made by the patient. As of September 2007, around 80% of the \"\n- whole rural population of China had signed up (about 685 million people). The system is tiered, depending on the location. If patients go to a small hospital or\n- \" clinic in their local town, the scheme will cover from 70-80% of their bill. If they go to a county one, the percentage of the cost being covered falls to abou\"\n- \"t 60%. And if they need specialist help in a large modern city hospital, they have to bear most of the cost themselves, the scheme would cover about 30% of the \"\n- \"bill.[30]\\n\\\n On January 21, 2009, the Chinese government announced that a total of 850 billion yuan will be provided between 2009 and 2011 in order to improve the \"\n- \"existing health care system.[31]\\n\\\n [edit] Hong Kong SAR\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in Hong Kong\\n\\\n Hong Kong is one of the healthiest places in the world.[32] Because \"\n- of its early health education, professional health services, and well-developed health care and medication system, Hongkongers enjoy a life expectancy of 84 for\n- \" females and 78 for males,[33] which is the second highest in the world, and 2.94 infant mortality rate, the fourth lowest in the world.[34][35]\\n\\\n There are two m\"\n- \"edical schools in Hong Kong, and several schools offering courses in traditional Chinese medicine. The Hospital Authority is a statutory body that operates and \"\n- \"manages all public hospitals. Hong Kong has high standards of medical practice. It has contributed to the development of liver transplantation, being the first \"\n- |-\n in the world to carry out adult to adult live donor liver transplant in 1993.[36]\n [edit] India\n Main article: Healthcare in India\n India has a universal health ca\n- re system run by the local (state or territorial), governments. The government hospitals, some of which are among the best hospitals in India,[37] provide treat\n- |-\n ment at taxpayer expense. Most essential drugs are offered free of charge in these hospitals.\n Government hospitals provide treatment either free or at minimal c\n- harges. For example, an outpatient card at AIIMS (one of the best hospitals in India) costs a one time fee of rupees 10 (Around 20 cents US) and thereafter outp\n- atient medical advice is free. In-hospital treatment costs depend on financial condition of the patient and facilities utilized by him but are usually much less\n- \" than the private sector. For instance, a patient is waived treatment costs if he is below poverty line. Another patient may seek for an air-conditioned room if\"\n- \" he is willing to pay extra for it. The charges for basic in-hospital treatment and investigations are much less compared to the private sector. The cost for th\"\n- |-\n ese subsidies comes from annual allocations from the central and state governments.\n Primary health care is provided by city and district hospitals and rural pri\n- mary health centres (PHCs). These hospitals provide treatment free of cost. Primary care is focused on immunization, prevention of malnutrition, pregnancy, chil\n- d birth, postnatal care, and treatment of common illnesses.[citation needed] Patients who receive specialized care or have complicated illnesses are referred to\n- \" secondary (often located in district and taluk headquarters) and tertiary care hospitals (located in district and state headquarters or those that are teaching\"\n- \" hospitals).[citation needed] However, the fact that the government sector is understaffed and underfinanced and poor services at state run hospitals forces man\"\n- |-\n y people to visit private medical practitioners.\n Now organizations like Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotional Trust and other private organizations have s\n- |-\n tarted creating hospitals and clinics in India, which also provide free or subsidized health care and subsidized insurance plans.[citation needed]\n [edit] Israel\n- |-\n \n Main article: Health care in Israel\n \n \n \n \n \n This section does not cite any references or sources.

(October 2009)\\n\\n\\n\\\n In Israel, the National Health Insurance Law (or National Health Insurance Act) is \"\n- the legal framework which enables and facilitates basic, compulsory universal health care. The Law was put into effect by the Knesset on January 1, 1995, and wa\n- s based on recommendations put forward by a National Committee of Inquiry which examined restructuring the health care system in Israel in the late 1980s. Prior\n- \" to the law\'s passage approximately 85% of the population was already covered by voluntarily belonging to one of four nation-wide, not-for-profit health mainten\"\n- ance organizations (HMOs/sick funds). However, there were three problems associated with this arrangement. First, membership in the largest HMO, Clalit, require\n- \"d one to belong to the Histadrut labor organization, even if a person did not wish to (or could not) have such an affiliation while other HMOs restricted entry \"\n- to new members based on age, pre-existing conditions or other factors. Second, different HMOs provided different levels of benefit coverage or services to their\n- \" members and lastly was the issue mentioned above whereby a certain percentage of the population, albeit a small one, did not have health insurance coverage at \"\n- |-\n all.\n \n \n \n \n \n This section may stray from the topic of the article&#160;into the topic of another article, Health care in Israel. Please help improve this section o\n- |-\n r discuss this issue on the talk page.\n \n \n Before the law went into effect, all the HMOs collected premiums directly from members. However, upon passage of the la\n- w, a new progressive national health insurance tax was levied through Israel\'s social security agency which then re-distributes the proceeds to the HMOs based o\n- n their membership and its demographic makeup. This ensured that all citizens would now have health coverage. While membership in one of the HMOs now became com\n- pulsory for all, free choice was introduced into movement of members between HMOs (a change is allowed once per year), effectively making the various HMOs compe\n- te equally for members among the populace. Annually, a committee appointed by the ministry of health publishes a \"basket\" or uniform package of medical services\n- \" and prescription formulary which all HMOs must provide as a minimum service to all their members. Achieving this level of equality ensured that all citizens ar\"\n- e guaranteed to receive basic healthcare regardless of their HMO affiliation which was one of the principal aims of the law. An appeals process was put in place\n- \" to handle rejection of treatments and procedures by the HMOs and evaluating cases falling outside the \\\"basket\\\" of services or prescription formulary.\\n\\\n While the\"\n- \" law is generally considered a success and Israeli citizens enjoy a high standard of medical care comparatively, with more competition having been introduced in\"\n- \"to the field of health care in the country, and order having been brought into what was once a somewhat disorganized system, the law nevertheless does have its \"\n- critics. First and foremost among the criticisms raised is that the \"basket\" may not provide enough coverage. To partly address this issue, the HMOs and insuran\n- \"ce companies (often in conjunction with employers) began offering additional \\\"supplementary\\\" insurance to cover certain additional services not included in the \"\n- \"basket. However, since this insurance is optional, critics argue that it goes against the spirit of the new law which stressed equality among all citizens with \"\n- respect to healthcare. Another criticism is that in order to provide universal coverage to all, the tax income base amount (the maximum amount of yearly earning\n- s that are subject to the tax) was set rather high, causing many high-income taxpayers to see the amount they pay for their health premiums (now health tax) sky\n- |-\n rocket. Finally, some complain about the constantly rising costs of copayments for certain services.\n [edit] Singapore\n Main article: Health care in Singapore\n Sin\n- gapore has a universal health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through compulsory savings and price controls, while the private secto\n- r provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources.[38] Singapore currently has the\n- \" lowest infant mortality rate in the world (equaled only by Iceland) and among the highest life expectancies from birth, according to the World Health Organizat\"\n- ion.[39] Singapore has \"one of the most successful healthcare systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in communi\n- ty health outcomes,\" according to an analysis by global consulting firm Watson Wyatt.[40] Singapore\'s system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payro\n- \"ll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as \\\"actively regulating the supply \"\n- and prices of healthcare services in the country\" to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a \"very difficult system to r\n- eplicate in many other countries.\" Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by t\n- \"he government\'s programs.[40]\\n\\\n [edit] Taiwan (Republic of China)\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in Taiwan\\n\\\n The current health care system in Taiwan, known as National \"\n- Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars\n- . The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.[41] NHI is mainly financed t\n- hrough premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-fo\n- |-\n r-service predominated for both public and private providers.\n NHI delivers universal coverage offered by a government-run insurer. The working population pays p\n- \"remiums split with their employers, others pay a flat rate with government help and the poor or veterans are fully subsidized. Taiwan\\xE2\\x80\\x99s citizens no longer hav\"\n- |-\n e to worry about going bankrupt due to medical bills.[42]\n Under this model, citizens have free range to choose hospitals and physicians without using a gatekeep\n- \"er and do not have to worry about waiting lists. NHI offers a comprehensive benefit package that covers preventive medical services, prescription drugs, dental \"\n- \"services, Chinese medicine, home nurse visits and many more. Working people do not have to worry about losing their jobs or changing jobs because they will not \"\n- lose their insurance. Since NHI, the previously uninsured have increased their usage of medical services. Most preventive services are free such as annual check\n- \"ups and maternal and child care. Regular office visits have co-payments as low as US $5 per visit. Co-payments are fixed and unvaried by the person\\xE2\\x80\\x99s income.[\"\n- |-\n 43]\n [edit] Thailand\n Main article: Health care in Thailand\n Thailand introduced universal coverage reforms in 2001, becoming one of only a handful of lower-middle\n- \" income countries to do so. Means-tested health care for low income households was replaced by a new and more comprehensive insurance scheme, originally known a\"\n- s the 30 baht project, in line with the small co-payment charged for treatment. People joining the scheme receive a gold card which allows them to access servic\n- es in their health district, and, if necessary, be referred for specialist treatment elsewhere. The bulk of finance comes from public revenues, with funding all\n- ocated to Contracting Units for Primary Care annually on a population basis. According to the WHO, 65% of Thailand\'s health care expenditure in 2004 came from t\n- he government, 35% was from private sources.[38] Although the reforms have received a good deal of critical comment, they have proved popular with poorer Thais,\n- \" especially in rural areas, and survived the change of government after the 2006 military coup. The then Public Health Minister, Mongkol Na Songkhla, abolished \"\n- \"the 30 baht co-payment and made the UC scheme free. It is not yet clear whether the scheme will be modified further under the coalition government that came to \"\n- |-\n power in January 2008.[44][45][46]\n [edit] Europe\n Virtually all of Europe has publicly sponsored and regulated universal health care. The public plans in some co\n- \"untries provide basic or \\\"sick\\\" coverage only; their citizens can purchase supplemental insurance for additional coverage. Countries with universal health care \"\n- include Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, I\n- celand, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal,[47] Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, S\n- |-\n lovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine[48] and the United Kingdom.[49]\n [edit] Austria\n In Austria, public health care (the care, not the running of hospita\n- ls itself) is funded by means of so called \"Social insurance contributions\" accounting for approx. 24% of the salary, they are therefore no taxes as such. 7% of\n- \" the contribution is reserved for health coverage in one of Austria\'s 22 public insurances, but cannot exceed EUR 281,- monthly (USD 399,-). Depending on the jo\"\n- b, somebody will be insured at one of the 9 state-run territorial health funds or at job specific insurances, e.g. public employees or farmers have their own (c\n- ompulsory) health insurance. 22 public insurances for 8 million people is subject to violent criticism, as tremendous savings could be reached by unifying the i\n- nsurances to one centralized provider. However, no Austrian state is willing to give up its own public insurances as it is sphere of action for electoral campai\n- gns. The operation of hospitals is not paid by social contributions, but by taxes. This means that general health coverage adds up to much more and is therefore\n- \" more expensive as often depicted. Austria spends approx. 10% of its GDP for health coverage.\\n\\\n [edit] Finland\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in Finland\\n\\\n In Finland, pub\"\n- lic medical services at clinics and hospitals are run by the municipalities (local government) and are funded 76% by taxation, 20% by patients through access ch\n- arges, and 4% by others. Private provision is mainly in the primary care sector. There are a few private hospitals [50]. The main hospitals are either municipal\n- \"ly owned (funded from local taxes) or run by the medical teaching universities (funded jointly by the municipalities and the national government). According to \"\n- \"a survey published by the European Commission in 2000, Finland\'s is in the top 4 of EU countries in terms of satisfaction with their hospital care system: 88% o\"\n- f Finnish respondents were satisfied compared with the EU average of 41.3%.[51] Finnish health care expenditures are below the European average.[citation needed\n- \"] The private medical sector accounts for about 14 percent of total health care spending. Only 8% of doctors choose to work in private practice, and some of the\"\n- |-\n se also choose to do some work in the public sector.[citation needed]\n Taxation funding is partly local and partly nationally based. The national social insuranc\n- e institution KELA reimburses part of patients prescription costs and makes a contribution towards private medical costs (including dentistry) if they choose to\n- \" be treated in the private sector rather than the public sector. Patient access charges are subject to annual caps. For example GP visits cost \\xE2\\x82\\xAC11 per visit w\"\n- \"ith annual \\xE2\\x82\\xAC33 cap; hospital outpatient treatment \\xE2\\x82\\xAC22 per visit; a hospital stay, including food, medical care and medicines \\xE2\\x82\\xAC26 per 24 hours, or \\xE2\\x82\\xAC12 if\"\n- \" in a psychiatric hospital. After a patient has spent \\xE2\\x82\\xAC590 per year on public medical services (including prescription drugs), all treatment and medications t\"\n- |-\n hereafter in that year are free.\n [edit] Germany\n Main article: Health care in Germany\n Germany has the world\'s oldest universal health care system, with origins d\n- \"ating back to Otto von Bismarck\'s Health Insurance Act of 1883.[52] As mandatory health insurance, it originally applied only to low-income workers and certain \"\n- government employees, but has gradually expanded to cover the great majority of the population.[53] The system is decentralized with private practice physicians\n- \" providing ambulatory care, and independent, mostly non-profit hospitals providing the majority of inpatient care. Approximately 92% of the population is covere\"\n- d by a \'Statutory Health Insurance\' plan, which provides a standardized level of coverage through any one of approximately 1100 public or private sickness funds\n- . Standard insurance is funded by a combination of employee contributions, employer contributions and government subsidies on a scale determined by income level\n- . Higher income workers sometimes choose to pay a tax and opt out of the standard plan, in favor of \'private\' insurance. The latter\'s premiums are not linked to\n- \" income level but instead to health status.[54]\\n\\\n Historically, the level of provider reimbursement for specific services is determined through negotiations betwe\"\n- \"en regional physician\'s associations and sickness funds. Since 1976 the government has convened an annual commission, comprised of representatives of business, \"\n- labor, physicians, hospitals, and insurance and pharmaceutical industries.[55] The commission takes into account government policies and makes recommendations t\n- \"o regional associations with respect to overall expenditure targets. In 1986 expenditure caps were implemented and were tied to the age of the local population \"\n- as well as the overall wage increases. Although reimbursement of providers is on a fee-for-service basis the amount to be reimbursed for each service is determi\n- ned retrospectively to ensure that spending targets are not exceeded. Capitated care, such as that provided by U.S. health maintenance organizations, has been c\n- onsidered as a cost containment mechanism but would require consent of regional medical associations, and has not materialized.[56] Copayments were introduced i\n- n the 1980s in an attempt to prevent overutilization and control costs. The average length of hospital stay in Germany has decreased in recent years from 14 day\n- s to 9 days, still considerably longer than average stays in the U.S. (5 to 6 days).[57][58] The difference is partly driven by the fact that hospital reimburse\n- ment is chiefly a function of the number of hospital days as opposed to procedures or the patient\'s diagnosis. Drug costs have increased substantially, rising n\n- \"early 60% from 1991 through 2005. Despite attempts to contain costs, overall health care expenditures rose to 10.7% of GDP in 2005, comparable to other western \"\n- |-\n European nations, but substantially less than that spent in the U.S. (nearly 16% of GDP).[59]\n [edit] Ireland\n Main article: Health care in Ireland\n The public hea\n- \"lth care system of the Republic of Ireland is governed by the Health Act 2004, which established a new body to be responsible for providing health and personal \"\n- social services to everyone living in Ireland - the Health Service Executive. The new national health service came into being officially on 1 January 2005; howe\n- ver the new structures are currently in the process of being established as the reform programme continues. In addition to the public-sector, there is also a la\n- |-\n rge private healthcare market.\n [edit] Netherlands\n Main article: Health care in the Netherlands\n The Netherlands has a dual-level system. All primary and curative\n- \" care (i.e. the family doctor service and hospitals and clinics) is financed from private compulsory insurance. Long term care for the elderly, the dying, the l\"\n- ong term mentally ill etc. is covered by social insurance funded from taxation. According to the WHO, the health care system in the Netherlands was 62% governme\n- |-\n nt funded and 38% privately funded as of 2004.[38]\n Insurance companies must offer a core universal insurance package for the universal primary, curative care wh\n- ich includes the cost of all prescription medicines. They must do this at a fixed price for all. The same premium is paid whether young or old, healthy or sick.\n- \" It is illegal in The Netherlands for insurers to refuse an application for health insurance, to impose special conditions (e.g. exclusions, deductibles, co-pay\"\n- \"s etc or refuse to fund treatments which a doctor has determined to be medically necessary). The system is 50% financed from payroll taxes paid by employers to \"\n- \"a fund controlled by the Health regulator. The government contributes an additional 5% to the regulator\'s fund. The remaining 45% is collected as premiums paid \"\n- by the insured directly to the insurance company. Some employers negotiate bulk deals with health insurers and some even pay the employees\' premiums as an emplo\n- yment benefit). All insurance companies receive additional funding from the regulator\'s fund. The regulator has sight of the claims made by policyholders and th\n- \"erefore can redistribute the funds its holds on the basis of relative claims made by policy holders. Thus insurers with high payouts will receive more from the \"\n- regulator than those with low payouts. Thus insurance companies have no incentive to deter high cost individuals from taking insurance and are compensated if th\n- ey have to pay out more than might be expected. Insurance companies compete with each other on price for the 45% direct premium part of the funding and try to n\n- \"egotiate deals with hospitals to keep costs low and quality high. The competition regulator is charged with checking for abuse of dominant market positions and \"\n- the creation of cartels that act against the consumer interests. An insurance regulator ensures that all basic policies have identical coverage rules so that no\n- \" person is medically disadvantaged by his or her choice of insurer.\\n\\\n Hospitals in the Netherlands are also regulated and inspected but are mostly privately run a\"\n- nd for profit, as are many of the insurance companies. Patients can choose where they want to be treated and have access to information on the internet about th\n- e performance and waiting times at each hospital. Patients dissatisfied with their insurer and choice of hospital can cancel at any time but must make a new agr\n- |-\n eement with another insurer.\n Insurance companies can offer additional services at extra cost over and above the universal system laid down by the regulator, e.g\n- \". for dental care. The standard monthly premium for health care paid by individual adults is about \\xE2\\x82\\xAC100 per month. Persons on low incomes can get assistance f\"\n- rom the government if they cannot afford these payments. Children under 18 are insured by the system at no additional cost to them or their families because the\n- \" insurance company receives the cost of this from the regulator\'s fund.\\n\\\n [edit] United Kingdom\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in the United Kingdom\\n\\\n Each of the Countri\"\n- \"es of the United Kingdom has a National Health Service that provides public healthcare to all UK permanent residents that is free at the point of need and paid \"\n- for from general taxation. However, since Health is a devolved matter, considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries.[60]\n- |-\n \n [edit] England\n Main article: Healthcare in England\n The National Health Service (NHS), created by the National Health Service Act 1946 has provided the majority\n- \" of healthcare in England since its launch on 5 July 1948.\\n\\\n The NHS Constitution for England documents at high level, the objectives of the NHS, the legal rights\"\n- \" and responsibilities of the various parties (patients, staff, NHS trust boards) and the guiding principles which govern the service.[61] The NHS constitution m\"\n- \"akes it clear that it provides a comprehensive service, available to all irrespective of age, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, religion or belief; \"\n- \"that access to NHS services is based on clinical need and not an individual\\xE2\\x80\\x99s ability to pay; and that care is never refused on unreasonable grounds. Patient \"\n- choice in terms of doctor, care, treatments and place of treatment is an important aspect of the NHS\'s ambition, and in some cases patients can elect for treatm\n- ent in other European countries at the NHS\'s expense. Wait times are low, with most people able to see their primary care doctor on the same day or the followin\n- g day[62] and only 36.1% of hospital admissions are from a waiting list, with the remainder being either emergencies admitted immediately or else pre-booked adm\n- issions or similar (e.g. child birth) [63]. No patient should experience a delay of more than 18 weeks from initial hospital referral to final treatment[64]. Th\n- |-\n is includes the time for all investigative tests and consultations, and two thirds of patients are currently treated in under 12 weeks.[65]\n Although centrally f\n- \"unded there is no large central bureaucracy to manage it. Responsibility is highly devolved to geographical areas through Strategic Health Authorities and even \"\n- more locally through NHS primary care trusts , NHS hospital trusts and increasingly to NHS foundation trusts which are providing even more decentralized service\n- s within the NHS framework, with more decision making taken by local people, patients and staff. The central government office, the Department of Health, is not\n- \" involved in day to day decision making in either the Strategic Health Authorities or the individual local trusts (primarily health, hospital or ambulance) or t\"\n- he national specialist trusts such as NHS Blood and Transplant, but it does lay down general guidelines for them to follow. Local trusts are accountable to thei\n- |-\n r local populations, whilst government ministers are accountable to Parliament for the service overall.\n The NHS provides, among other things, primary care, in-p\n- \"atient care, long-term healthcare, psychiatric care and treatments ophthalmology and dentistry. All treatment is free with the exception of certain charges for \"\n- prescriptions, dentistry and ophthalmology (which themselves are free to children, the elderly, the unemployed and those on low incomes). Eighty-nine percent of\n- \" NHS prescriptions are obtained free of charge, mosly children, pensioners and pregnat women. Others pay a flat rate of \\xC2\\xA37.20[66], and others may cap their ann\"\n- ual charges. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance. Private insurance accounts for only 4 percent of heal\n- th expenditure and covers little more than a tenth of the population. [67]. Private insurers in the UK only cover acute care from specialists. They do not cover\n- \" generalist consultations, pre-existing conditions, medical emergencies, organ transplants, chronic conditions such as diabetes or conditions such as pregnancy \"\n- or HIV. [68] Most NHS general practitioners are private doctors who contract to provide NHS services but most hospitals are publicly owned and run through NHS T\n- rusts. A few NHS medical services such as \"surgicentres\") are sub-contracted to private providers [69] as are some non-medical services (such as catering). Some\n- \" capital projects such as new hospitals have been funded through the Private Finance Initiative, enabling investment without excessive strain on the public sect\"\n- |-\n or borrowing requirement.\n [edit] Northern Ireland\n Main article: Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland\n Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland is the des\n- |-\n ignation of the national public health service in Northern Ireland.\n [edit] Scotland\n Main article: Healthcare in Scotland\n NHS Scotland, created by the National H\n- ealth Service (Scotland) Act 1947, was also launched on 5 July 1948 though it has always been a separate organisation.

The Australian Senate rejected the changes multiple times and they were passed only after a joint s\n- itting after the 1974 double dissolution election. However, Medibank was supported by the subsequent Fraser Coalition (Australia) government and became a key fe\n- \"ature of Australia\\xE2\\x80\\x99s public policy landscape. The exact structure of Medibank/Medicare, in terms of the size of the rebate to doctors and hospitals and the wa\"\n- y it has administered, has varied over the years. The original Medibank program proposed a 1.35% levy (with low income exemptions) but these bills were rejected\n- \" by the Senate, and so Medibank was funded from general taxation. In 1976, the Fraser Government introduced a 2.5% levy and split Medibank in two: a universal s\"\n- |-\n cheme called Medibank Public and a government-owned private health insurance company, Medibank Private.\n During the 1980s, Medibank Public was renamed Medicare b\n- y the Hawke Labor government, which also changed the funding model, to an income tax surcharge, known as the Medicare Levy, which was set at 1.5%, with exemptio\n- ns for low income earners.[71] The Howard Coalition government introduced an additional levy of 1.0%, known as the Medicare Levy Surcharge, for those on high an\n- nual incomes ($70,000) and do not have adequate levels of private hospital coverage.[72] This was part of an effort by the Coalition to encourage take-up of pri\n- vate health insurance. According to WHO, government funding covered 67.5% of Australia\'s health care expenditures in 2004; private sources covered the remaining\n- \" 32.5% of expenditures.[38]\\n\\\n [edit] New Zealand\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in New Zealand\\n\\\n As with Australia, New Zealand\'s healthcare system is funded through gen\"\n- eral taxation. According to the WHO, government sources covered 77.4% of New Zealand\'s health care costs in 2004; private expenditures covered the remaining 22.\n- |-\n 6%.[38]\n [edit] Economics\n Main article: Health care economics\n [edit] Funding models\n Universal health care in most countries has been achieved by a mixed model of\n- \" funding. General taxation revenue is the primary source of funding, but in many countries it is supplemented by specific levies (which may be charged to the in\"\n- dividual and/or an employer) or with the option of private payments (either direct or via optional insurance) for services beyond that covered by the public sys\n- |-\n tem.\n Almost all European systems are financed through a mix of public and private contributions.[73] The majority of universal health care systems are funded pr\n- imarily by tax revenue (e.g. Portugal[73] and Spain). Some nations, such as Germany, France[49] and Japan[74] employ a multi-payer system in which health care i\n- s funded by private and public contributions. However, much of the non-government funding is by defined contributions by employers and employees to regulated no\n- |-\n n-profit sickness funds. These contributions are compulsory and vary according to a person\'s salary, and are effectively a form of hypothecated taxation.\n A dist\n- inction is also made between municipal and national healthcare funding. For example, one model is that the bulk of the healthcare is funded by the municipality,\n- \" speciality healthcare is provided and possibly funded by a larger entity, such as a municipal co-operation board or the state, and the medications are paid by \"\n- |-\n a state agency.\n Universal health care systems are modestly redistributive. Progressivity of health care financing has limited implications for overall income in\n- |-\n equality.[75]\n [edit] Single-payer\n Main article: Single-payer health care\n The term single-payer health care is used in the United States to describe a funding me\n- chanism meeting the costs of medical care from a single fund. Although the fund holder is usually the government, some forms of single-payer employ a public-pri\n- |-\n vate system.\n [edit] Public\n Some countries (notably the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain) have eliminated insurance entirely and choose to fund health care direct\n- ly from taxation. Other countries with insurance-based systems effectively meet the cost of insuring those unable to insure themselves via social security arran\n- |\n gements funded from taxation, either by directly paying their medical bills or by paying for insurance premiums for those affected.\n [edit] Compulsory insurance\n\n- This is usually enforced via legislation requiring residents to purchase insurance, though sometimes, in effect, the government provides the insurance. Sometime\n- s there may be a choice of multiple public and private funds providing a standard service (e.g. as in Germany) or sometimes just a single public fund (as in Can\n- |-\n ada).\n In some European countries where there is private insurance and universal health care, such as Germany, Belgium, and The Netherlands, the problem of adver\n- se selection (see Private insurance below) is overcome using a risk compensation pool to equalize, as far as possible, the risks between funds. Thus a fund with\n- \" a predominantly healthy, younger population has to pay into a compensation pool and a fund with an older and predominantly less healthy population would receiv\"\n- e funds from the pool. In this way, sickness funds compete on price and there is no advantage to eliminate people with higher risks because they are compensated\n- \" for by means of risk-adjusted capitation payments. Funds are not allowed to pick and choose their policyholders or deny coverage, but then mainly compete on pr\"\n- |-\n ice and service. In some countries the basic coverage level is set by the government and cannot be modified.[76]\n Ireland at one time had a \"community rating\" sy\n- \"stem through VHI, effectively a single-payer or common risk pool. The government later opened VHI to competition but without a compensation pool. This resulted \"\n- in foreign insurance companies entering the Irish market and offering cheap health insurance to relatively healthy segments of the market which then made higher\n- \" profits at VHI\'s expense. The government later re-introduced community rating through a pooling arrangement and at least one main major insurance company, BUPA\"\n- \", then withdrew from the Irish market.\\n\\\n [edit] Private insurance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n This article may be inaccurate in or unbalanced towards certain viewpoints.

(June 2009)\n \n \n In some countries with universal coverage, priva\n- te insurance often excludes many health conditions which are expensive and which the state health care system can provide. For example in the UK, one of the lar\n- |-\n gest private health care providers is BUPA which has the following list of general exclusions[77].\n Dental/oral treatment (such as fillings, gum disease, jaw shr\n- \"inkage, etc)\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; pregnancy and childbirth\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; temporary relief of symptoms\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; convalescence, rehabilitation and general nursing care\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; drugs and dressings fo\"\n- \"r out-patient or take-home use\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; screening and preventive treatment; birth control, conception, sexual problems and sex changes\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; allergies or allergic diso\"\n- \"rders; chronic conditions\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; eyesight\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; physical aids and devices\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; *deafness; cosmetic, reconstructive or weight loss treatment\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; ageing, menopaus\"\n- \"e and puberty&#160;; dialysis\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; complications from excluded or restricted conditions/ treatment&#160;; HRT and bone densitometry\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; learning difficulti\"\n- \"es, behavioural and developmental problems&#160;; overseas treatment and repatriation&#160;; AIDS/HIV\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; pre-existing or special conditions&#160;; experi\"\n- \"mental drugs and treatment\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; sleep problems and disorders&#160;; speech disorders\\xE2\\x80\\xA0\\n\\\n all of which (except overseas repatriation) are available for free \"\n- \"or very low cost from the NHS. (\\xE2\\x80\\xA0 indicates that treatment may be provided in certain circumstances)\\n\\\n Where voluntary insurance (often private) is predominant,\"\n- \" such as in the U.S., medical (health) insurance is subject to the well-known economic problem of adverse selection which may also be referred to as a market fa\"\n- ilure.[citation needed] Adverse selection in insurance markets occurs because those providing insurance have limited information with which to estimate the heal\n- th risks on which they may need to pay future claims.[citation needed] In simple terms, those with poor health are more likely to apply for insurance and more l\n- ikely to need treatments requiring high insurance company payouts.[citation needed] Those with good health may find the cost of insurance too high for the perce\n- ived benefit, and some will remove themselves from the risk pool.[citation needed] This adverse selection concentrates the risk pool, thereby further raising co\n- sts.[citation needed] In practical terms, the potential for adverse selection means that private insurers have an economic incentive to use medical underwriting\n- \" to \'weed out\' high cost applicants in order to avoid adverse selection.[citation needed] Among the potential solutions posited by economists are single payer s\"\n- ystems as well as other methods of ensuring that health insurance is universal, such as by requiring all citizens to purchase insurance and limiting the ability\n- \" of insurance companies to deny insurance to individuals or vary price between individuals.[78][79]\\n\\n\\\n [edit] See also\\n\\n\\\n Health care compared - tabular comparisons\"\n- \" of the US, Canada, and other countries not shown above.\\n\\\n Health care reform debate in the United States\\n\\\n Health insurance cooperative\\n\\\n Millennium Development Goal\"\n- |-\n s\n National health insurance\n Publicly-funded health care\n Single-payer health care\n \n [edit] References\n \n \n ^ a b Insuring America\'s Health: Principles and Recommenda\n- |-\n tions, Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science, 2004-01-14\n ^ \"Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Questions and Answers\" (PDF).

The term has a history of scholarly debate surrounding its precise meaning, but a castle is usually considered to be the \"private fortif\n- ied residence\" of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a fortress, which was not a home, or a fortified town, which was a public defence. Over the extended pe\n- riod of time that castles were built they took on a great many forms with many different features, but some, such as the curtain wall and arrow slits, were comm\n- |-\n onplace.\n Castles originated in the 9th&#160;and 10th&#160;centuries, when the fall of the Carolingian Empire in Europe and the rise of feudal society led to the\n- \" territory of the collapsing empire being divided between individual lords and princes, and an emphasis on personal defence. Castles controlled their immediate \"\n- areas, and were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as protection from an enemy. Although t\n- \"heir military origins are often emphasised, castles also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local \"\n- |-\n populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near elements such as a mill, integral to life in the community.\n Many castles were o\n- riginally built from earth and timber, and had their defences replaced later by stone equivalents. In the late 12th&#160;and early 13th&#160;century, a scientif\n- ic approach to castle defence emerged. Towers proliferated, with an emphasis on flanking fire, and many new castles were polygonal, while previously they had re\n- \"lied more on the lay of the land and were curvilinear, or relied on concentric defence&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 several stages of defence within each other that could all funct\"\n- ion at the same time, thereby maximising the castle\'s firepower. The origin of these changes in defence has been attributed to a mixture of influence from the C\n- \"rusades&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 where castle technology was advanced such as the new type of concentric fortification&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and drawing on earlier defences such as Roman fo\"\n- rts for inspiration. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, and devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defen\n- |-\n ce into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress, and to dominate their landscape.\n Gunpowder, introduced to Europe i\n- n the 14th&#160;century, did not have an immediate impact on castle building. Castles do not show adaptation to resist bombardment by cannons until the 15th&#16\n- \"0;century, when artillery became powerful enough to break down walls. Although castles were built across Europe well into the 16th&#160;century, new techniques \"\n- to deal with improved cannon eventually led to them becoming uncomfortable and undesirable places to live, and so true castles went into decline, replaced by ar\n- tillery forts with no role in administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18th&#160;century onwards, there was a renewed interest in cas\n- |-\n tles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no defensive purpose.\n \n \n \n \n Contents\n \n \n 1 Definition\n \n 1\n- |-\n .1 Etymology\n 1.2 Defining characteristics\n \n \n 2 Common features\n \n 2.1 Motte\n 2.2 Bailey and enceinte\n 2.3 Keep\n 2.4 Curtain wall\n 2.5 Moat\n 2.6 Gatehouse\n 2.7 Other feat\n- |+\n ures\n \n \n 3 History\n \n 3.1 Antecedents\n 3.2 Origins and early castles\n 3.3 Innovation and scientific design\n 3.4 Advent of gunpowder\n 3.5 Later use and revival castles\n \n- |-\n \n 4 Construction\n 5 Social centre\n 6 Castle landscapes\n 7 Warfare\n 8 See also\n 9 References\n 10 Further reading\n 11 External links\n \n \n \n \n \n //<![CDATA[\n if (window.showTocTo\n- |-\n ggle) { var tocShowText = \"show\"; var tocHideText = \"hide\"; showTocToggle(); } \n //]]>\n \n [edit] Definition\n [edit] Etymology\n \n \n \n \n The Norman \"White Tower\", the keep\n- \" of the Tower of London, exemplifies all uses of a castle: city defence, a residence, and a place of refuge in times of crisis.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Castle is derived from the Lat\"\n- \"in word castellum. This is a diminutive of the word castrum, which means \\\"fortified place\\\". The Old English castel, French ch\\xC3\\xA2teau, Spanish castillo, Italian c\"\n- \"astello, as well as other European words for castle derive from castellum.[2] The word castle was introduced into English shortly before the Norman Conquest to \"\n- denote this type of building, then new to England, introduced to the country by Normans working for Edward the Confessor.[3] Although the various terms used for\n- \" castles in Europe derive from the same root, they are not universally applied to the same types of structures. The French ch\\xC3\\xA2teau is used to describe a grand \"\n- \"country house at the heart of an estate, regardless of the presence of fortifications.[4]\\n\\\n [edit] Defining characteristics\\n\\\n In its simplest terms, the definition \"\n- of a castle accepted amongst academics is \"a private fortified residence\".[5] This contrasts with earlier fortifications, such as Anglo Saxon burhs and walled c\n- \"ities such as Constantinople and Antioch in the Middle East: castles were not communal defences but were built and owned by the local feudal lord, either for th\"\n- emselves of for their monarch.[6] In the late 20th&#160;century, there was a trend to refine the definition of a castle by including the criterion of feudal own\n- ership, thus tying castles to the medieval period. However this does not necessarily reflect what medieval people called castles. During the First Crusade (1096\n- \"\\xE2\\x80\\x931099) the Frankish armies encountered walled settlements and forts that they indiscriminately called castles, but would not be considered such under the mode\"\n- |-\n rn definition.[5]\n \n \n \n \n Windsor Castle in England was first built as a fortification of the Norman Conquest, and today is home to Queen Elizabeth II of the United\n- \" Kingdom.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Castles served a range of purposes, the most important of which were military, administrative, and domestic. Early castles were primarily military i\"\n- \"nstitutions, places of protection from an enemy. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which could be used as a base of operations \"\n- in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England as both defensive and offensive tools to pacify the inhabitants.[7] As William the Co\n- nqueror advanced through England after the Norman Conquest in 1066, he fortifed key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087 he establis\n- hed 36&#160;castles such as Warwick Castle, which was used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.[8][9] However, a recent trend to view castles les\n- s as military institutions and more as social structures has questioned the current definition. During the Middle Ages, castles tended to lose their military si\n- |-\n gnificance and became more important as residences and statements of power.[10]\n In Britain the term \"castle\" has also been erroneously used to refer to Iron Age\n- \" fortifications such as Maiden Castle, Dorset.[11] A castle was not only a bastion and prison but also a place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers.\"\n- \" Over time the aesthetics of the design became more important, as the castle\'s appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant. Cast\"\n- les were built as defensive measures and offensive weapons, but comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls. Although castles still prov\n- |-\n ided protection from low levels of violence in later periods, eventually they were succeeded by country houses as high status residences.[12]\n [edit] Common feat\n- \"ures\\n\\\n [edit] Motte\\n\\\n Main article: Motte-and-bailey\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The wooden palisades surmounting mottes were often later replaced in stone, as in this example at Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau \"\n- |-\n de Gisors in France.\n \n \n A motte was a mound with a flat top. The mounds were often artificial, although sometimes they incorporated a pre-existing feature of the\n- \" landscape. The excavation of earth for the mound would leave a ditch around the motte, which acted as a further defence. Sometimes a nearby stream would be div\"\n- erted to flood the ditch, creating a moat. Motte and moat derive from the same Old French word, indicating that they were originally associated features and dep\n- \"ended on each other for their construction. Although the motte is usually associated with the bailey to form a motte-and-bailey castle, this was not always the \"\n- \"case and there are instances where a motte existed on its own. \\\"Motte\\\" refers to the mound alone, but it was often surmounted by a fortified structure, such as \"\n- a keep, and the flat top would be surrounded by a palisade.[13] The motte was accessed by a flying bridge as represented by the Bayeux Tapestry\'s depiction of C\n- \"h\\xC3\\xA2teau de Dinan.[14] Sometimes a motte covered an older castle or hall, whose rooms now became underground storage areas and prisons beneath a new donjon.[15]\\n\"\n- |-\n [edit] Bailey and enceinte\n Main article: Enceinte\n A bailey, also called a ward, was a fortified enclosure. They were a common feature of castles, and most had a\n- t least one. The keep on top of the motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home of t\n- \"he rest of the lord\'s household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities could all be expected to be \"\n- \"found in the bailey. There was a progression for lords to build more comfortable accommodation for themselves within the bailey, which resulted in the creation \"\n- of another bailey that separated the high status buildings such as the lord\'s chambers and the chapel, from the everyday structures such as the workshops and ba\n- rracks.[16] Although often associated with the motte-and-bailey type of castle, baileys could be found as independent defensive structures. These simple fortifi\n- cations were called ringworks.[17] The terms bailey and enceinte are linked, as the enceinte was the castle\'s main defensive enclosure. A castle could have seve\n- ral baileys but only one enceinte. Castles with no keep and which relied on their outer defences for protection are sometimes called enceinte castles;[18] these\n- \" were the earliest form of castles, before the donjon arrived in the 10th century.[19]\\n\\\n [edit] Keep\\n\\\n Main article: Keep\\n\\\n A keep was a great tower and usually the s\"\n- \"trongest point of a castle before the introduction of concentric defence. Keep was not a term used in the medieval period&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the term was applied from the\"\n- \" 16th&#160;century onwards&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and donjon was used to refer to great towers,[20] or turris in Latin. Dungeon is a corrupted form of donjon and means a dark\"\n- \", unwelcoming prison.[21] Although often the strongest part of a castle and a last place of refuge if the outer defences fell, the keep was not left empty in ca\"\n- se of attack but was used as a residence by the lord who owned the castle, or his guests or representatives.[22] Initially this was only the usual pattern in En\n- gland, when after the Norman Conquest of 1066 the \"conquerors lived for a long time in a constant state of alert\"; elsewhere the lord\'s wife presided over a sep\n- \"arate residence (domus, aula or mansio in Latin) close to the keep, and the donjon was a barracks and headquarters. Gradually the two functions merged into the \"\n- same building; for many examples choosing the appropriate term can be difficult, and the highest residential storeys have large windows.[23] In motte-and-bailey\n- \" castles, the keep was on top of the motte.[13]\\n\\\n [edit] Curtain wall\\n\\\n Main article: Curtain wall (fortification)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Carcassonne, France, showing the classic feat\"\n- |-\n ures of the curtain walls, defensive ditch with arched bridge, and cylindrical flanking towers, with a gatehouse and additional wooden defensive structures.\n \n \n C\n- \"urtain walls were defensive walls enclosing a bailey. They had to be high enough to make scaling the walls with ladders difficult and thick enough to withstand \"\n- bombardment from siege engines which from the 15th&#160;century onwards included artillery. A typical wall could be 3&#160;m (9.8&#160;ft) wide and 12&#160;m (3\n- \"9&#160;ft) tall, although sizes varied greatly between castles. To protect them from undermining, curtain walls were sometimes given a stone skirt around their \"\n- base. Walkways along the tops of the curtain walls allowed defenders to rain missiles on enemies from above, and battlements gave them further protection. Curta\n- in walls would be studded with towers to allow enfilading fire along the wall.[24] Arrow slits in the walls did not become common in Europe until the 13th&#160;\n- |-\n century, for fear that they might compromise the wall\'s strength.[25]\n [edit] Moat\n Main article: Moat\n A moat was a defensive ditch with steep sides, and could be\n- \" either water-filled or dry. Its purpose was to stop engines such as siege towers from reaching the curtain wall and to prevent the walls from being undermined.\"\n- \" Water moats are found in low lying areas. Moats were often crossed by a drawbridge, although these were often replaced by stone bridges. The moat around Flint \"\n- \"Castle in Wales needed 1,800&#160;excavators to build. Fortified islands could be added to the moat, adding another layer of defence. Water defences, including \"\n- moats as well as natural lakes, had the benefit of dictating the enemy\'s approach to the castle.[26] The 13th-century Caerphilly Castle, also in Wales, has some\n- \" of the largest water defences in Western Europe, on a site covering over 30&#160;acres (120,000&#160;m2), created by flooding the valley to the south of the ca\"\n- |-\n stle.[27]\n [edit] Gatehouse\n Main article: Gatehouse\n An undeveloped entrance is the weakest part in a circuit of defences. To overcome this, the gatehouse was dev\n- eloped, allowing those inside the castle to control the flow of traffic. In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in\n- \" stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot, so to allow the defenders to see the gate without exposing themselves projecting towers were added on each si\"\n- de of the gate, in a style similar to that developed by the Romans.[28] Contained within the building would be a series of defences to make a direct assault mor\n- \"e difficult than battering down a simple gate. There would be one or more portcullis&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 a wooden grille reinforced with metal to block a passage&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 \"\n- and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry an enemy. The passage through the gatehouse would have been lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant ha\n- \"d to spend being shot at in a confined space.[29] It is a popular myth that so-called murder-holes&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 openings in the roof of the gateway passge&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 \"\n- were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead, and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was completel\n- y impractical. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, similar to machicolations or to pour water to extinguish fires.[30] Provision was made i\n- n the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation, so the gate was never left undefended, although this evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of\n- \" defence.[31] The entrance to a castle could be further elaborated through the addition of a barbican. This consisted of a rampart and ditch in front of the gat\"\n- ehouse.[32] Developed in the 13th and 14th centuries,[33] it could also include a tower. The purpose of a barbican was not just to provide another line of defen\n- |-\n ce but to dictate the only approach to the gate.[34]\n [edit] Other features\n Battlements were most often found surmounting curtain walls, although also on the top\n- s of gatehouses, and comprised several elements; crenellations, hoardings and machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating\n- \" crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks on top of a wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at or\"\n- \" drop objects on attackers at the base of the wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Ma\"\n- chicolations were stone openings in the top of the wall that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base off the wall in a similar fashion to hoarding\n- s.[35] Arrowslits, also commonly called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts to be fired on attack\n- ers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but the size of the opening could also impede the defender if it w\n- \"as too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming.[36]\\n\\\n [edit] History\\n\\\n [edit] Antecedents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Ambleside Roman \"\n- |-\n fort, England\n \n \n Historian Charles Coulson states that the accumulation of wealth and resources such as food in ancient societies led to the need for defensive s\n- \"tructures. The earliest fortifications originate from the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. \"\n- \"Northern Europe was slower than the east to develop defensive structures and it was not until the Bronze Age that hill forts were developed, which proliferated \"\n- across Europe in the Iron Age. They differed to their eastern counterparts through the use of earthworks rather than stone as a building material.[37] Many eart\n- hworks survive today, along with evidence of palisades to accompany the ditches. In Europe, oppida emerged in the 2nd&#160;century BC; they were densely inhabit\n- ed fortified settlements, such as the oppidum of Manching, and developed from hill forts.[38] The Romans encountered fortified settlements such as hill forts an\n- \"d oppida when expanding their territory into northern Europe.[38] Although primitive, they were often effective, and required extensive siege engines and other \"\n- siege warfare techniques to overcome, such as at the Battle of Alesia. The Romans\' own fortifications (castra) varied from simple temporary earthworks thrown up\n- \" by armies on the move, to elaborate permanent stone constructions, notably the milecastles of Hadrian\'s Wall. Roman forts were generally rectangular with round\"\n- \"ed corners \\xE2\\x80\\x93 a \\\"playing-card shape\\\".[39]\\n\\\n [edit] Origins and early castles\\n\\\n Like the feudal society they were part of, castles had their origins in the 9th&#160\"\n- ;and 10th&#160;centuries. This period saw the emergence of a social and military elite in the Carolingian Empire and the development of mounted fighting. Fighti\n- ng on horseback was a costly and time consuming endeavour, requiring specialised equipment and trained horses, and for their efforts these early knights were gr\n- anted land by the lords for whom they fought. The link between knight and lord was the basis of feudalism, and could go higher up the social scale with loyaltie\n- s between lords, dukes, princes, and kings. When the Carolingian Empire collapsed in the 9th&#160;and 10th&#160;centuries, it took with it effective centralised\n- \" administration,[40] and it fell to the landed elite to take over control. This led to the privatisation of government, with local lords taking on the responsib\"\n- ility for the local economy and justice. Although castles were private buildings, lordship was a public office and the holder had a responsibility to protect hi\n- s peasants.[41] There is a traditional view that feudalism was a tool of social disintegration that contributed to the downfall of the Carolingian Empire, howev\n- er modern academic opinion is that it was a successor to previous government rather than a rival.[42] Castles sometimes required the permission of the king or o\n- ther high authority. Charles the Bald prohibited the construction of castles without his permission and ordered them destroyed; this could be the earliest refer\n- ence to castles being built without permission, breaking the feudal agreement between lord and vassal, however there are very few castles dated with certainty f\n- \"rom the mid-9th&#160;century. Converted into a donjon in around 950, Dou\\xC3\\xA9-la-Fontaine, in France, is the oldest standing castle in Europe.[43]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n One of the e\"\n- \"arliest representations of a castle from the Bayeux Tapestry. It depicts attackers of Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Dinan in France using fire, one of the threats to wooden castl\"\n- \"es.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Military historian Allen Brown asserts that in the absence of a working state and the breakdown of society associated with the decline of the Carolingian \"\n- \"Empire, feudal ties became more important. The rise of castles is not solely attributed to defence of the new feudal lords\\xE2\\x80\\x99 lands, but as a reaction to attack\"\n- s by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings.[40] It is likely that the castle evolved from the practice of fortifying a lordly home. In a time of social unrest, a lord w\n- \"ould wish to protect his home or hall, and the greatest threat was that of fire as they were usually wooden. To protect against this, and keep other threats at \"\n- \"bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an \"\n- artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers.[44] While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is an\n- cient, raising a motte to exploit the advantages of height is a medieval innovation.[45] A bank and ditch enclosure was a simple form of defence, and when found\n- \" without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enh\"\n- anced by the addition a stone curtain wall.[46] Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door.\n- \" This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 to make it harder to throw objects in&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and to change the entrance from ground floor to\"\n- \" first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls and contained the lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s household.[4\"\n- \"7] Castles were not just used as defensive sites, but to enhance a lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area,[4\"\n- |-\n 8] and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.[49]\n References to castles in texts such as charters from 1000 onwards i\n- ncreased greatly. Historians have interpreted this as evidence of a sudden increase in the number of castles in Europe around this time; their interpretation ha\n- s been supported by archaeologists dating the construction of castle sites through the examination of ceramics.[50] The increase in Italy began in the 950s, wit\n- h numbers of castles increasing by a factor of three to five every 50&#160;years, whereas other parts of Europe such as France and Spain were slower. In 950, Pr\n- ovence was home to 12&#160;castles, by 1000 this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100.[51] Despite the common period in which castles rose to pro\n- \"minence in Europe, their form and design varied from region to region. In the early 11th&#160;century, the motte&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 an artificial mound surmounted by a pa\"\n- \"lisade and tower&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was the most common form of castle in Europe, aside from Scandinavia.[51] Castles were introduced into England shortly before the Norm\"\n- \"an Conquest in 1066.[52] The motte and bailey&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 a motte with an outer enclosure&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 remained the dominant form of castle in England, Wales, and Irel\"\n- |-\n and well into the 12th&#160;century.[53] At the same time, castle architecture in mainland Europe became more sophisticated.[54]\n \n \n \n \n Built in 1138, Castle Risin\n- \"g in England is an example of an elaborate donjon.[55]\\n\\n\\n\\\n The donjon&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 or great tower[56]&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was at the centre of this change in castle architecture\"\n- \" in the 12th&#160;century. Central towers proliferated, and typically had a square plan, with walls 3 to 4&#160;m (9.8 to 13&#160;ft) thick. Their decoration em\"\n- ulated Romanesque architecture, and sometimes incorporated double windows similar to those found in church bell towers. Donjons, which were the residence of the\n- \" lord of the castle, evolved to become more spacious. The changes in design changed from utilitarian to decorative to impose upon the landscape as a symbol of l\"\n- ordly power, sometimes compromising defence for the sake of display.[54] Historians have interpreted the widespread presence of castles across Europe in the 11t\n- |-\n h&#160;and 12th&#160;centuries as evidence that warfare was common, and usually between local lords.[57]\n In some countries, it was necessary to obtain the permi\n- ssion of the king through a licence to crenellate, or else the builder risked it being slighted. This was not universal, as in some countries, the monarch had l\n- \"ittle control over lords, or required the construction of new castles to aid in securing the land&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 as was the case in England after 1066 and the Holy La\"\n- \"nd during the Crusades&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 so was unconcerned about granting permission. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built cast\"\n- les, and as a result there are 4,000 in the country. Before the 12th&#160;century, castles were as uncommon in Denmark as they had been in England before the No\n- |-\n rman Conquest. The introduction of castles to Denmark was a reaction to attacks from Wendish pirates, and they were usually intended as coastal defences.[58]\n [e\n- \"dit] Innovation and scientific design\\n\\\n Until the 12th century, stone-built and earth and timber castles were contemporary,[59] but by the late 12th&#160;century \"\n- the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly attributed to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of t\n- imber and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone.[60] Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork\n- \" castles were by no means useless.[61] This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; at the s\"\n- \"tart of the 15th&#160;century Owain Glynd\\xC5\\xB5r\\xE2\\x80\\x99s castle at Sycharth, founded in the late 11th&#160;century, was a timber structure.[62][63]\\n\\\n In the late 12th&#16\"\n- 0;century, there was an obvious change in castle architecture. Until then, castles probably had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrows\n- lits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the lay of the land, and the resu\n- lt was often irregular or curvilinear. The design of castles was of course not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the m\n- id-12th&#160;century.[64] By the end of the 12th&#160;century or the early 13th&#160;century, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in sh\n- ape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level t\n- o allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall. These later castles would not always have a keep, but this may have been because the more compl\n- \"ex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers provided space for habitation to make up for the \"\n- loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to t\n- \"he castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 although there was great variety in the styles of g\"\n- \"ateway and entrances&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and one or more portcullis.[65]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The gatehouse to the inner ward of Beeston Castle, England, was built in the 1220s and has an \"\n- |-\n entrance between two half-round towers.[66]\n \n \n When seeking to explain this change in the complexity and style of castles, antiquarians found their answer in the\n- \" Crusades. It seemed logical that the Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architectu\"\n- \"re. There were legends such as that of Lalys&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 an architect from Palestine who reputedly went to Wales after the Crusades and greatly enhanced the castle\"\n- \"s in the south of the country&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and it was assumed that great architects such as James of Saint George originated in the East. However, in the mid-20th&#\"\n- 160;century this view was cast into doubt. Legends were discredited, and in the case of James of Saint George, it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d\'E\n- \"sp\\xC3\\xA9ranche, in France. If the innovations in fortification had derived from the East, it would have been expected for their influence to be seen from 1100 onwar\"\n- \"ds, immediately after the Christians were victorious in the First Crusade (1096\\xE2\\x80\\x931099), rather than nearly 100&#160;years later.[67] Roman remains in western E\"\n- urope were still upstanding in many places, and as they too featured flanking round-towers, and entrances between two flanking towers. The castle builders of we\n- stern Europe were aware of and influenced by Roman design as demonstrated by the reuse of Saxon shore forts in England, a late Roman innovation despite their na\n- \"me, and in Spain the wall around the city of Avila imitated Roman architecture when it was built in 1091.[67] It has been argued&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 by historian Smail in \"\n- \"Crusading warfare&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 that the case for the influence of eastern fortification on the west has been overstated, and that crusaders of the 12th&#160;century\"\n- \" in fact learnt very little about scientific design from Byzantine and Saracen defences.[68] The explanation for this is that a well sited castle that made use \"\n- of natural defences and had strong ditches and walls had no need for a scientific design. An example of this approach is Karak Castle. Although there were no sc\n- \"ientific elements to its design it was almost impregnable, and in 1187 Saladin chose to lay siege to the castle and starve out its garrison rather than risk an \"\n- |-\n assault.[68]\n After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did not return to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the principality of Antioch, the\n- \" County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their acquisitions were designed mostly by Syrian mas\"\n- \"ter-masons. Their design was very similar to a Roman fort or Byzantine tetrapyrgia: a square curtain wall with towers in each corner, also usually square and no\"\n- t projecting much beyond the curtain wall. In the interior, the keep would have had a square plan and generally be undecorated.[69] While castles were used to h\n- \"old a site and control movement of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified.[70] Castle architecture in the East became more \"\n- \"complex around the late 12th and early 13th&#160;century after the stalemate of the Third Crusade (1189\\xE2\\x80\\x931192). Both Christians and Muslims created fortificati\"\n- ons, and the character of each was different. Saphadin, the 13th-century ruler of the Saracens, created structures with large rectangular towers that influenced\n- \" Muslim architecture and were copied again and again, however they had little influence on Crusader castles.[71]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Krak des Chevaliers is a concentric castle \"\n- \"built with both rectangular and rounded towers. It is amongst the best preserved Crusader castles.[72]\\n\\n\\n\\\n In the early 13th&#160;century, Crusaders castles were \"\n- mostly built by Military Orders, such as the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Knights of the Teutonic Order. They were responsible for the foundation o\n- f sites such as Krak des Chevaliers, Margat, and Belvoir. The forms of the castle varied not just between orders, but individually from castle to castle, althou\n- gh it was common for the castles founded in this period to have concentric defences.[73] The concept, which originated in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, w\n- as to remove the reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be more than one ring of defensive wall, one i\n- nside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If an assailant made it past the first line o\n- \"f defences into the outer enclosure, they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall to secure \"\n- \"the fall of the castle.[74] Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe, for instance when Edward I of England&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 who had himself been on Crusade&\"\n- \"#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 built castles in Wales in the late 13th&#160;century, four of the eight he founded were concentric.[73][74] Not all the features of the Crusader castle\"\n- s from the 13th &amp;nbspcentury were emulated in Europe; for instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the entrance in the side of a tower and for th\n- ere to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this feature to be found in Europe.\n- |-\n [73]\n It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels; something that contemporary builders in Europe were wary o\n- f, believing that they weakened the wall\'s structural integrity. Arrowslits did not compromise the wall\'s strength, but it was not until Edward I\'s programme of\n- \" castle building that they were adopted in Europe.[25] The Crusades also led to the introduction of machicolations into western architecture. Until the 13th&#16\"\n- 0;century, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed\n- \" the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the \"\n- |-\n East long before the arrival of the Crusades, and perhaps as early as the first half of the 8th&#160;century in Syria.[75]\n Although France has been described as\n- \" \\\"the heartland of medieval architecture\\\", the English were at the forefront of castle architecture in the 12th&#160;century. French historian Francois Gebelin \"\n- said:[76] \"The great revival in military architecture was led, as one would naturally expect, by the powerful kings and princes of the time; by the sons of Will\n- iam the Conqueror and their descendants, the Plantagenets, when they became dukes of Normandy. These were the men who built all the most typical twelfth-century\n- \" fortified castles remaining to-day\\\".[77] Despite this, by the beginning of the 15th&#160;century, the rate of castle construction in England and Wales went int\"\n- o decline; the new castles were generally of a lighter build than earlier structures and presented few innovations, although strong sites were still created suc\n- h as that of Raglan in Wales. At the same time, French castle architecture came to the fore and led the way in the field of medieval fortifications. Across Euro\n- \"pe&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 particularly the Baltic, Germany, and Scotland&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 castles were built well into the 16th&#160;century.[78]\\n\\\n [edit] Advent of gunpowder\\n\\\n Artillery\"\n- \" powered by gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns are not recorded until the 1380s and were unpredictable and inaccurate \"\n- \"weapons.[79] Castles were adapted to allow small guns&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 averaging between 19.6 and 22&#160;kg (43 and 49&#160;lb)&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 to fire from towers. These gun\"\n- s were too heavy for a man to carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle on the edge of the gun port he could fire the weapon. The g\n- \"un ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the \"\n- \"timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there \"\n- is an intact example at in Doornenburg Castle in Denmark. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on t\n- |-\n op to allow the gunner to aim.[80]\n \n \n \n \n The rounded walls of Sarzana Castle in Italy are adaptated to gunpowder.\n \n \n This form is very common in castles adapted fo\n- \"r guns, found in Egypt, Italy, Scotland, and Spain, and elsewhere in between. Other types of port, though less common were horizontal slits&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 allowing on\"\n- \"ly lateral movement&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and large square openings, which allowed greater movement.[80] The use of guns for defence gave rise to artillery castles, such as \"\n- \"that of Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Ham in France, Defences against guns was not developed until a later stage.[81] Ham is an example of the trend for new castles to dispense w\"\n- \"ith earlier features such as machicolations, tall towers, and crenellations.[82]\\n\\\n Bigger guns were developed, and in the 15th&#160;century became an alternative \"\n- \"to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages before the advent\"\n- \" of gunpowder&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 were those of a greater range and greater power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made bigger and bigger. By the 1450s\"\n- \" guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mohammed II at the Siege of Constantinople.[83] The response towards more eff\"\n- ective cannons was to build thicker walls than in previous castles and to prefer round towers as the curving sides were more likely to deflect a shot than a fla\n- \"t surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures had to find a way to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled \"\n- behind a castle\'s curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.[84] Often, castles constructed before the age of gunpowder would be incapable of using gun\n- s as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface fo\n- r the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which\n- \" avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle\'s defences. These could be built from earthier earth or stone and were used to mount w\"\n- |-\n eapons.[85]\n Around 1500, the innovation of the angled bastion over curved was developed in Italy.[86] The elite who were responsible for castle construction wer\n- e forced to choose between the new type which could withstand cannon-fire but as a result was ugly and uncomfortable to live in, or to stick with an earlier mor\n- e elaborate style with had more aesthetic appeal and was more of a status symbol. The second choice was more popular, and while the castle retained its use as a\n- \" status symbol, it became apparent that earlier fortifications were unable to stand up to cannons, and so there was no point in trying to make the site genuinel\"\n- |-\n y defensible.[87]\n \n \n \n \n Fortaleza Ozama in the Dominican Republic was the first castle built in the Americas\n \n \n However, some true castles were built in the Americ\n- \"as by the Spanish, English, and French colonies. The first stage of Spanish fort construction has been termed the \\\"castle period\\\", which lasted from 1492 until \"\n- the end of the 16th&#160;century.[88] Starting with Fortaleza Ozama, \"these castles were essentially European medieval castles transposed to America.\"[89] Among\n- \" other defensive structures (including forts and citadels), castles were also built in New France towards the end of the 17th&#160;century.[89] Where artillery \"\n- \"was not as developed as on the battle-fields of Europe, some of Montreal\'s outlying forts were built like the fortified manor houses of France. Fort Longueuil, \"\n- \"built from 1695\\xE2\\x80\\x931698 by a baronial family, has been described as \\\"the most medieval-looking fort built in Canada\\\".[90] The manor house and stables were within\"\n- \" a fortified bailey, with a tall round turret in each corner. The \\\"most substantial castle-like fort\\\" near Montr\\xC3\\xA9al was Fort Senneville, built in 1692 with squ\"\n- are towers connected by thick stone walls, as well as a fortified windmill.[91] Stone forts such as these served as defensive residences, as well as imposing st\n- |-\n ructures to prevent Iroquois incursions.[92]\n Although castle construction faded towards the 16th&#160;century, they did not necessarily all fall out of use. Som\n- e retained some role in local administration and became law courts, while others are still handed down in aristocratic families as hereditary seats. A particula\n- rly famous example of this is Windsor Castle in England which was founded in the 11th&#160;century and is home to the monarch of the United Kingdom.[93] In othe\n- r cases they still had a role in defence. Tower houses, which are closely related to castles and include pele towers, were defended towers that were permanent r\n- esidences built in the 14th to 17th centuries. Especially common in Ireland and Scotland, they could be up to five storeys high and succeeded common enclosure c\n- \"astles and were built by a greater social range of people. While unlikely to provide as much protection as a more complex castle, they offered security against \"\n- |-\n raiders and other small threats.[94][95]\n [edit] Later use and revival castles\n According to archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham, \"the great country\n- \" houses of the seventeenth to twentieth centuries were, in a social sense, the castles of their day\\\".[96] Although there was a trend for the elite to move from \"\n- \"castles into country houses in the 17th&#160;century, castles were not completely useless. In later conflicts, such as the English Civil War (1641\\xE2\\x80\\x931651), many\"\n- \" castles were refortified, although subsequently slighted to prevent them from being used again.[97]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Neuschwanstein is a 19th-century neo-romantic castle bu\"\n- |-\n ilt by Ludwig II of Bavaria.\n \n \n Artificial ruins became popular in the 18th&#160;century as a manifestation of a romantic interest in the Middle Ages and chivalr\n- y, and as part of the broader Gothic Revival in architecture. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar,\n- \" although differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on el\"\n- ements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but they served no military purpose and were solely for display.[98] Revival or mock castles, mos\n- t of which were country houses, were particularly common in the British Isles, for example Belvoir Castle and Eastnor Castle in England and Castell Coch in Wale\n- \"s.[99] Edwin Lutyens\' Castle Drogo (1911\\xE2\\x80\\x931930) was the last flicker of this movement in England.[100] In Mexico, Chapultepec Castle, a former military strongh\"\n- old, used as the imperial residence of the monarchs of the Second Mexican Empire, was created in the Neo-Classical and Neo-Gothic styles.[101] Also, the 19th-ce\n- |-\n ntury Neuschwanstein is one such revival castle in Germany.[102]\n [edit] Construction\n See also: Medieval technology&#160;and Stonemasonry\n \n \n \n \n Construction of a l\n- |-\n arge tower, with scaffolding and masons at work. The holes mark the position of the scaffolding in earlier stages of construction.\n \n \n Once the site of a castle h\n- \"ad been selected&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 whether a strategic position or one intended to dominate the landscape as a mark of power&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the building material had to be sel\"\n- \"ected. An earth and timber castle was cheaper and easier to erect than one built from stone. The costs involved in construction are not well recorded, and most \"\n- surviving records relate to royal castles.[103] A castle with earthen ramparts, a motte, and timber defences and buildings could have been constructed by an uns\n- killed workforce. The source of man-power was probably from the local lordship, and the tenants would already have the necessary skills of felling trees, diggin\n- g, and working timber necessary for an earth and timber castle. Possibly coerced into working for their lord, the construction of an earth and timber castle wou\n- \"ld not have been a drain on a client\\xE2\\x80\\x99s funds. In terms of time, it has been estimated that an average sized motte&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 5&#160;m (16&#160;ft) high and 15&#\"\n- \"160;m (49&#160;ft) wide at the summit&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 would have taken 50&#160;people about 40&#160;working days. An exceptionally expensive motte and bailey was that \"\n- \"of Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 for \\xC2\\xA320. The high cost, relative to other castles of its type, was because labourers had to be imported.[103]\\n\\\n Although thei\"\n- r cost varied according to factors such as their complexity and transport costs for material, it is certain that stone castles cost a great deal more than those\n- \" built from earth and timber. Even a very small tower, such as Peveril Castle, would have cost around \\xC2\\xA3200. In the middle were castles such as Orford, which wa\"\n- \"s built in the late 12th&#160;century for \\xC2\\xA31,400, and at the upper end were those such as Dover, which cost about \\xC2\\xA37,000 between 1112 and 1191.[104] Spending \"\n- \"on the scale of the vast castles such as Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau Gaillard (an estimated \\xC2\\xA315,000 to \\xC2\\xA320,000 between 1196 and 1198) was easily supported by The Crown, but for \"\n- \"lords of smaller areas, castle building was a very serious and costly undertaking. It was usual for a stone castle to take the best part of a decade to finish. \"\n- \"The cost of a large castle built over this time (anywhere from \\xC2\\xA31,000 to \\xC2\\xA310,000) would take the income from several manors, severely impacting on a lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s \"\n- \"finances.[105] Cost in the late 13th&#160;century were of a similar order, with castles such as Beaumaris and Rhuddlan costing \\xC2\\xA314,500 and \\xC2\\xA39,000 respectively\"\n- \". Edward I\\xE2\\x80\\x99s campaign of castle-building in Wales cost \\xC2\\xA380,000 between 1277 and 1304, and \\xC2\\xA395,000 between 1277 and 1329.[106] Renowned designer Master James\"\n- \" of Saint George, responsible for the construction of Beaumaris, explained the cost:\\n\\n\\\n In case you should wonder where so much money could go in a week, we would\"\n- \" have you know that we have needed&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and shall continue to need 400 masons, both cutters and layers, together with 2,000 less skilled workmen, 100&#160;c\"\n- arts, 60&#160;wagons and 30&#160;boats bringing stone and sea coal; 200&#160;quarrymen; 30&#160;smiths; and carpenters for putting in the joists and floor board\n- s and other necessary jobs. All this takes no account of the garrison&#160;... nor of purchases of material. Of which there will have to be a great quantity&#16\n- \"0;... The men\\xE2\\x80\\x99s pay has been and still is very much in arrears, and we are having the greatest difficulty in keeping them because they have simply nothing to \"\n- |-\n live on.[107]\n \n Not only were stone castles expensive to build in the first place, but their maintenance was a constant drain. They contained a lot of timber, wh\n- \"ich was often unseasoned and as a result needed careful upkeep. Castles such as Exeter and Gloucester were often given figures of between \\xC2\\xA320 and \\xC2\\xA350 annually\"\n- \" in the late 12th&#160;century for constant repairs.[108]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The Castle of the Teutonic Order in Malbork, Poland, is an example of brick-built castle and was b\"\n- \"uilt in a style different to that of castles in western Europe and the Near East.[109]\\n\\n\\n\\\n Medieval machines and inventions, such as the treadwheel crane, became \"\n- indispensable during construction, and techniques of building wooden scaffolding were improved upon from Antiquity.[110] Finding stone for shell keeps and castl\n- \"e walls was the first concern of medieval builders, and a major preoccupation was to have quarries close at hand.[111] There are examples of some castles where \"\n- \"stone was quarried on site, such as Chinon, Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Coucy and Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau Gaillard.[111]\\n\\\n Brick-built structures were not necessarily weaker than their stone-bu\"\n- ilt counterparts. In England, brick production proliferated along the south-east coast due to an influx of Flemish weavers and a reduction in the amount of avai\n- lable, leading to a demand for an alternative building material. Brick castles are less common than stone or earth and timber constructions, and often it was ch\n- \"osen for its aesthetic appeal or because it was in fashion, encouraged by the brick architecture of the Low Countries. For example, when Tattershall Castle was \"\n- built between 1430 and 1450, there was plenty of stone available nearby, however the owner, Lord Cromwell, chose to use brick. About 700,000 bricks were used to\n- \" built the castle, which has been described as \\xE2\\x80\\x9Cthe finest piece of medieval brick-work in England\\xE2\\x80\\x9D.[112] Brick castles were predominant in Scandinavia and \"\n- |-\n the Baltic;[113] Denmark had few quarries, and as a result, most of its castles are earth and timber affairs, or later on built from brick.[114]\n [edit] Social c\n- |\n entre\n Main article: Court (royal)\n \n \n \n \n God Speed! by Edmund Blair Leighton, 1900: a late Victorian view of a lady giving a favour to a knight about to do battle\n\n- \"\\n\\n\\\n Due to the lord\'s presence in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as \"\n- \"without the support of his more powerful tennants, a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately \"\n- below them on the social scale, but absentee lords found their power weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit a\n- ll his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.[115] To allow the l\n- ord to concentrate on his duties regarding administration, he had a household of servants to take care of chores such as providing food. The household was run b\n- y a chamberlain, while a treasurer took care of the estate\'s written records. Royal households took essentially the same form as baronial households, although o\n- n a much larger scale and the positions were more prestigious.[116] Without the presence of a lord\'s household, usually because he was staying elsewhere, a cast\n- le would have been a quiet place with few residents, focused on maintaining the castle.[117] Not just a utilitarian structure, as social centres castles were al\n- \"so important places for display. Builders took the opportunity to draw on symbolism to evoke a sense of chivalry that was aspired to in the Middle Ages amongst \"\n- \"the elite. Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features.[118] The \"\n- \"right to crenelate, when granted by a monarch&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 though it was not always necessary&amp;bsp;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was important not just as it allowed a lord to defend his \"\n- \"property but because crenelations and other accoutrements associated with castles were prestigious through their use by the elite.[119]\\n\\\n The purpose of marriage \"\n- \"between the medieval elites was to secure land, not for love; girls were married in their teens, but boys did not marry until they came of age.[120] There is a \"\n- popular conception that women played a peripheral role in the medieval castle household, and that it was dominated by the lord himself. This derives from the im\n- age of the castle as a martial institution, but most castles in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never involved in conflicts or sieges, so the domest\n- \"ic life is a neglected facet.[121] The lady was given a \\\"marriage portion\\\" of her husband\'s estates&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 usually about a third&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 which were hers for \"\n- life, and her husband would inherit on her death; it was her duty to administer them directly, as the lord administered his own land.[122] Despite generally bei\n- ng excluded from military service, a woman could be in charge of a castle, either on behalf of her lordly husband or if she was widowed. Because of their influe\n- nce within the medieval household women influenced construction and design, sometimes through direct patronage; historian Charles Coulson emphasises the role of\n- \" women in applying \\\"a refined aristocratic taste\\\" to castles due to their long term residence.[123] Courtly love was the eroticisation of love between the nobil\"\n- \"ity. Emphasis was placed on restraint between lovers. It was sometimes in private and was expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments. The legend of \"\n- Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages.[124] It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other,\n- \" although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 Henry I of England had over 20&#160;bast\"\n- \"ards for instance&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.[125]\\n\\\n [edit] Castle landscapes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The approach to Kenilworth Castle, Engl\"\n- |-\n and, was lengthened to form a winding route through a moat and an artificial water landscape.\n \n \n As castles were not simply military buildings but centres of adm\n- inistration and symbols of power, they had a significant impact on the landscape around them. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems d\n- \"ue to their role in managing the lord\'s estate,[126] which gave them greater influence over resources.[127] Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer \"\n- parks and were important in their maintenance. Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, and many were found next to castles. Not only were they practical i\n- |-\n n that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.[128]\n Although sometimes the const\n- \"ruction of a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it is more common for the villages nearby to have grown as a result \"\n- of the presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle.[126] The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confi\n- ned to Europe; when Safad Castle was founded in Galilee, in the Holy Land, during the 13th&#160;century, the nearby town benefited from its presence as people c\n- ould now move freely in the area and the 260&#160;villages locally became profitable.[129] When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local l\n- andscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord.[130] Settlements grew naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of p\n- roximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importa\n- \"nce&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement dep\"\n- |-\n opulated.[131]\n During and shortly after the Norman Conquest of England, castles were inserted into important pre-existing towns to control and subdue the popula\n- ce. They were usually location with reference to any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structur\n- es occupying the desired site. In Lincoln, 166&#160;houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a m\n- oat for the castle. As the military importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and the\n- ir financial and judicial roles.[132] When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11th&#160;and 12th&#160;centuries, settlement in those countr\n- |-\n ies was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns is often linked with the creation of a castle.[133]\n Symbolism in relation to castles and their sett\n- ing was very important, as demonstrated by the proximity of high status features such as fish ponds. Also often found near to a castle, sometimes within its def\n- ences, was the parish church.[134] This has been interpreted as a relationship between the church and feudal lords, where the lords patronised the church, which\n- \" was one of the most important institutions of medieval society.[135] Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military can be\"\n- \" highly symbolic. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 comprising a moat and several satellite ponds&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 forced anyone approaching t\"\n- he castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway.[136] Another example is that of the\n- \" 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advance castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and t\"\n- he moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site look more impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer a\n- round the castle, ensuring they got a good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.[137] This also dem\n- onstrates that licenses to crenellate were not solely about a desire to defend oneself, but to have proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who\n- \" was the one responsible for granting permission.[138]\\n\\\n [edit] Warfare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n A trebuchet at Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau des Baux in France\\n\\n\\n\\\n As a static structure, castles could ofte\"\n- n be avoided as their immediate area of influence was about 400&#160;metres (1,300&#160;ft) and their weapons had a short range even early in the age of artille\n- ry. Although leaving an enemy behind the army would allow them to interfere with communications and make raids in the landscape to harry the army. Garrisons wer\n- e expensive, and as a result often small unless the castle was important.[139] Garrisons were smaller in peace time due to the cost of upkeep, and small castles\n- \" were manned by perhaps a couple of watchmen and gate-guards. Even in war garrisons were not necessarily large as too large a defending force would impair the c\"\n- \"astles ability to withstand a long siege; in 1403 a force of 37&#160;archers successfully defended Caernarfon Castle against two assaults by Owain Glynd\\xC5\\xB5r\'s al\"\n- lies during a long siege.[140] Early on, manning a castle was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later re\n- \"placed with paid forces.[140][141] If it was necessary to control the castle for strategic reasons, an army could lay siege to it and starve the defenders out. \"\n- \"Without relief from an outside source, the defending army would eventually submit, but sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies \"\n- of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later.[142] For th\n- e most heavily fortified sites it was more efficient to starve the garrison out that to assault it. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also a\n- \"pplied to the fortified towns of the day.[143] On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally.[144]\\n\\\n If forced to assault \"\n- \"a castle, there were many options available to the attackers. For wooden structures, such as early motte-and-baileys, fire was a real threat and attempts would \"\n- \"be made to set them on fire.[143] Project weapons had been used since antiquity and the mangonel and petraria&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 from Roman and Oriental origins respectiv\"\n- \"ely&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 were the main two that were used into the Middle Ages. The trebuchet, probably evolved from the petraria in the 13th&#160;century, was the most eff\"\n- \"ective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. \"\n- Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high trajectory of its projectile, and would be protected from direct fi\n- re by the curtain walls.[145] Eventually cannons developed to the point where they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the\n- \" main weapon in siege warfare.[83] Walls could be undermined by the creation of a sap; a mine would be dug to conceal the attackers approach to the wall, with w\"\n- ooden supports to prevent the tunnel from collapsing. When the target had been reached, the supports would be burned, caving in the tunnel and bringing down the\n- \" structure above.[146] Battering rams were also used, usually in the form of a tree trunk given an iron cap. They were used to batter down the castle gates, alt\"\n- \"hough they were sometimes used against walls, but with less effect.[147] As an alternative to creating a breach in the walls, an escalade could be attempted to \"\n- capture the walls, with fighting along the walkways on the curtain walls;[148] in this instance, attackers would be very vulnerable to arrowfire, particularly f\n- \"rom crossbows or the English longbow.[149]\\n\\\n [edit] See also\\n\\n\\\n Alc\\xC3\\xA1zar (Spanish castles)\\n\\\n Shiro (Japanese fortifications)\\n\\n\\\n [edit] References\\n\\n\\\n Notes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2\"\n- |\n 005, pp.&#160;7, 10.\n ^ Creighton &amp; Higham 2003, p.&#160;6.\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;32.\n ^ Allen Brown 2004, p.&#160;1.\n ^ a b Coulson 2003, p.&#160;16.\n\n- \"^ Liddiard 2005, pp.&#160;15\\xE2\\x80\\x9317.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;47.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, p.&#160;18.\\n\\\n ^ Stephens 1969, pp.&#160;452\\xE2\\x80\\x93475.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, pp.&#160;2, 6\\xE2\\x80\\x93\"\n- \"7.\\n\\\n ^ Creighton &amp; Higham 2003, pp.&#160;6\\xE2\\x80\\x937.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, p.&#160;2.\\n\\\n ^ a b Friar 2003, p.&#160;214.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;55.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Bar\"\n- \"th\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 397\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;22.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, pp.&#160;214, 216.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;105.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Barth\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 399\\n\\\n ^\"\n- \" Friar 2003, p.&#160;163.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;188.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;190.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Barth\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 402-6.

Typicall\n- |-\n y, costs are borne in the majority by government-funded programs.\n Universal health care systems vary according to the extent of government involvement in provid\n- ing care and/or health insurance. In some countries, such as the UK, Spain, and the Nordic countries, the government has a high degree of involvement in the com\n- missioning or delivery of health care services and access is based on residence rights not on the purchase of insurance. Others have a much more pluralistic del\n- ivery system based on obligatory health with contributory insurance rates related to salaries or income, and usually funded by employers and beneficiaries joint\n- ly. Sometimes the health funds are derived from a mixture of insurance premiums and government taxes. These insurance based systems tend to have a higher propor\n- \"tion of private medical providers obtaining reimbursement, often at heavily regulated rates, through mutual or publicly owned medical insurers. A few countries \"\n- such as the Netherlands and Switzerland operate via privately owned but heavily regulated private insurers. Americans use the term \"single-payer health care\" to\n- \" describe the pooling of health care funds into a single not-for-profit fund for a region or nation.

In Britain, the National Insurance Act 1911 marked the first steps there towards universal health care, coverin\n- g most employed persons and their financial dependents and all persons who had been continuous contributors to the scheme for at least five years whether they w\n- ere working or not. This system of health insurance continued in force until the creation of the National Health Service in 1948 which extended health care secu\n- rity to all legal residents. Most current universal health care systems were implemented in the period following the Second World War as a process of deliberate\n- \" healthcare reform, intended to make health care available to all, in the spirit of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, signed by e\"\n- |-\n very country doing so. The US did not ratify the social and economic rights sections, including Article 25\'s right to health.[2]\n [edit] Implementation and Compa\n- |-\n risons\n See also: Health care system\n Universal health care is a broad concept that has been implemented in several ways. The common denominator for all such prog\n- rams is some form of government action aimed at extending access to health care as widely as possible and setting minimum standards. Most implement universal he\n- alth care through legislation, regulation and taxation. Legislation and regulation direct what care must be provided, to whom, and on what basis. Usually some c\n- osts are borne by the patient at the time of consumption but the bulk of costs come from a combination of compulsory insurance and tax revenues. Some programs a\n- re paid for entirely out of tax revenues. In others tax revenues are used either to fund insurance for the very poor or for those needing long term chronic care\n- \".

The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS), is a new 2005 initiative to overhaul the healthcare system, particularly int\n- ended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, the annual cost of medical cover is 50 yuan (US$7) per person. Of that, 20 yuan is paid i\n- \"n by the central government, 20 yuan by the provincial government and a contribution of 10 yuan is made by the patient. As of September 2007, around 80% of the \"\n- whole rural population of China had signed up (about 685 million people). The system is tiered, depending on the location. If patients go to a small hospital or\n- \" clinic in their local town, the scheme will cover from 70-80% of their bill. If they go to a county one, the percentage of the cost being covered falls to abou\"\n- \"t 60%. And if they need specialist help in a large modern city hospital, they have to bear most of the cost themselves, the scheme would cover about 30% of the \"\n- \"bill.[30]\\n\\\n On January 21, 2009, the Chinese government announced that a total of 850 billion yuan will be provided between 2009 and 2011 in order to improve the \"\n- \"existing health care system.[31]\\n\\\n [edit] Hong Kong SAR\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in Hong Kong\\n\\\n Hong Kong is one of the healthiest places in the world.[32] Because \"\n- of its early health education, professional health services, and well-developed health care and medication system, Hongkongers enjoy a life expectancy of 84 for\n- \" females and 78 for males,[33] which is the second highest in the world, and 2.94 infant mortality rate, the fourth lowest in the world.[34][35]\\n\\\n There are two m\"\n- \"edical schools in Hong Kong, and several schools offering courses in traditional Chinese medicine. The Hospital Authority is a statutory body that operates and \"\n- \"manages all public hospitals. Hong Kong has high standards of medical practice.

The government hospitals, some of which are among the best hospitals in India,[37] provide treat\n- |-\n ment at taxpayer expense. Most essential drugs are offered free of charge in these hospitals.\n Government hospitals provide treatment either free or at minimal c\n- harges. For example, an outpatient card at AIIMS (one of the best hospitals in India) costs a one time fee of rupees 10 (Around 20 cents US) and thereafter outp\n- atient medical advice is free. In-hospital treatment costs depend on financial condition of the patient and facilities utilized by him but are usually much less\n- \" than the private sector. For instance, a patient is waived treatment costs if he is below poverty line. Another patient may seek for an air-conditioned room if\"\n- \" he is willing to pay extra for it. The charges for basic in-hospital treatment and investigations are much less compared to the private sector. The cost for th\"\n- |-\n ese subsidies comes from annual allocations from the central and state governments.\n Primary health care is provided by city and district hospitals and rural pri\n- mary health centres (PHCs). These hospitals provide treatment free of cost. Primary care is focused on immunization, prevention of malnutrition, pregnancy, chil\n- d birth, postnatal care, and treatment of common illnesses.[citation needed] Patients who receive specialized care or have complicated illnesses are referred to\n- \" secondary (often located in district and taluk headquarters) and tertiary care hospitals (located in district and state headquarters or those that are teaching\"\n- \" hospitals).[citation needed] However, the fact that the government sector is understaffed and underfinanced and poor services at state run hospitals forces man\"\n- |-\n y people to visit private medical practitioners.\n Now organizations like Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotional Trust and other private organizations have s\n- |-\n tarted creating hospitals and clinics in India, which also provide free or subsidized health care and subsidized insurance plans.[citation needed]\n [edit] Israel\n- |-\n \n Main article: Health care in Israel\n \n \n \n \n \n This section does not cite any references or sources.

(October 2009)\\n\\n\\n\\\n In Israel, the National Health Insurance Law (or National Health Insurance Act) is \"\n- the legal framework which enables and facilitates basic, compulsory universal health care. The Law was put into effect by the Knesset on January 1, 1995, and wa\n- s based on recommendations put forward by a National Committee of Inquiry which examined restructuring the health care system in Israel in the late 1980s. Prior\n- \" to the law\'s passage approximately 85% of the population was already covered by voluntarily belonging to one of four nation-wide, not-for-profit health mainten\"\n- ance organizations (HMOs/sick funds). However, there were three problems associated with this arrangement. First, membership in the largest HMO, Clalit, require\n- \"d one to belong to the Histadrut labor organization, even if a person did not wish to (or could not) have such an affiliation while other HMOs restricted entry \"\n- to new members based on age, pre-existing conditions or other factors. Second, different HMOs provided different levels of benefit coverage or services to their\n- \" members and lastly was the issue mentioned above whereby a certain percentage of the population, albeit a small one, did not have health insurance coverage at \"\n- |-\n all.\n \n \n \n \n \n This section may stray from the topic of the article&#160;into the topic of another article, Health care in Israel. Please help improve this section o\n- |-\n r discuss this issue on the talk page.\n \n \n Before the law went into effect, all the HMOs collected premiums directly from members. However, upon passage of the la\n- w, a new progressive national health insurance tax was levied through Israel\'s social security agency which then re-distributes the proceeds to the HMOs based o\n- n their membership and its demographic makeup. This ensured that all citizens would now have health coverage. While membership in one of the HMOs now became com\n- pulsory for all, free choice was introduced into movement of members between HMOs (a change is allowed once per year), effectively making the various HMOs compe\n- te equally for members among the populace. Annually, a committee appointed by the ministry of health publishes a \"basket\" or uniform package of medical services\n- \" and prescription formulary which all HMOs must provide as a minimum service to all their members. Achieving this level of equality ensured that all citizens ar\"\n- e guaranteed to receive basic healthcare regardless of their HMO affiliation which was one of the principal aims of the law. An appeals process was put in place\n- \" to handle rejection of treatments and procedures by the HMOs and evaluating cases falling outside the \\\"basket\\\" of services or prescription formulary.\\n\\\n While the\"\n- \" law is generally considered a success and Israeli citizens enjoy a high standard of medical care comparatively, with more competition having been introduced in\"\n- \"to the field of health care in the country, and order having been brought into what was once a somewhat disorganized system, the law nevertheless does have its \"\n- critics. First and foremost among the criticisms raised is that the \"basket\" may not provide enough coverage. To partly address this issue, the HMOs and insuran\n- \"ce companies (often in conjunction with employers) began offering additional \\\"supplementary\\\" insurance to cover certain additional services not included in the \"\n- \"basket. However, since this insurance is optional, critics argue that it goes against the spirit of the new law which stressed equality among all citizens with \"\n- respect to healthcare. Another criticism is that in order to provide universal coverage to all, the tax income base amount (the maximum amount of yearly earning\n- s that are subject to the tax) was set rather high, causing many high-income taxpayers to see the amount they pay for their health premiums (now health tax) sky\n- |-\n rocket. Finally, some complain about the constantly rising costs of copayments for certain services.\n [edit] Singapore\n Main article: Health care in Singapore\n Sin\n- gapore has a universal health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through compulsory savings and price controls, while the private secto\n- r provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources.[38] Singapore currently has the\n- \" lowest infant mortality rate in the world (equaled only by Iceland) and among the highest life expectancies from birth, according to the World Health Organizat\"\n- ion.[39] Singapore has \"one of the most successful healthcare systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in communi\n- ty health outcomes,\" according to an analysis by global consulting firm Watson Wyatt.[40] Singapore\'s system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payro\n- \"ll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as \\\"actively regulating the supply \"\n- and prices of healthcare services in the country\" to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a \"very difficult system to r\n- eplicate in many other countries.\" Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by t\n- \"he government\'s programs.[40]\\n\\\n [edit] Taiwan (Republic of China)\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in Taiwan\\n\\\n The current health care system in Taiwan, known as National \"\n- Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars\n- . The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.[41] NHI is mainly financed t\n- hrough premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-fo\n- |-\n r-service predominated for both public and private providers.\n NHI delivers universal coverage offered by a government-run insurer. The working population pays p\n- \"remiums split with their employers, others pay a flat rate with government help and the poor or veterans are fully subsidized. Taiwan\\xE2\\x80\\x99s citizens no longer hav\"\n- |-\n e to worry about going bankrupt due to medical bills.[42]\n Under this model, citizens have free range to choose hospitals and physicians without using a gatekeep\n- \"er and do not have to worry about waiting lists. NHI offers a comprehensive benefit package that covers preventive medical services, prescription drugs, dental \"\n- \"services, Chinese medicine, home nurse visits and many more. Working people do not have to worry about losing their jobs or changing jobs because they will not \"\n- lose their insurance. Since NHI, the previously uninsured have increased their usage of medical services. Most preventive services are free such as annual check\n- \"ups and maternal and child care. Regular office visits have co-payments as low as US $5 per visit. Co-payments are fixed and unvaried by the person\\xE2\\x80\\x99s income.[\"\n- |-\n 43]\n [edit] Thailand\n Main article: Health care in Thailand\n Thailand introduced universal coverage reforms in 2001, becoming one of only a handful of lower-middle\n- \" income countries to do so. Means-tested health care for low income households was replaced by a new and more comprehensive insurance scheme, originally known a\"\n- s the 30 baht project, in line with the small co-payment charged for treatment. People joining the scheme receive a gold card which allows them to access servic\n- es in their health district, and, if necessary, be referred for specialist treatment elsewhere. The bulk of finance comes from public revenues, with funding all\n- ocated to Contracting Units for Primary Care annually on a population basis. According to the WHO, 65% of Thailand\'s health care expenditure in 2004 came from t\n- he government, 35% was from private sources.[38] Although the reforms have received a good deal of critical comment, they have proved popular with poorer Thais,\n- \" especially in rural areas, and survived the change of government after the 2006 military coup. The then Public Health Minister, Mongkol Na Songkhla, abolished \"\n- \"the 30 baht co-payment and made the UC scheme free. It is not yet clear whether the scheme will be modified further under the coalition government that came to \"\n- |-\n power in January 2008.[44][45][46]\n [edit] Europe\n Virtually all of Europe has publicly sponsored and regulated universal health care. The public plans in some co\n- \"untries provide basic or \\\"sick\\\" coverage only; their citizens can purchase supplemental insurance for additional coverage. Countries with universal health care \"\n- include Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, I\n- celand, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal,[47] Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, S\n- |-\n lovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine[48] and the United Kingdom.[49]\n [edit] Austria\n In Austria, public health care (the care, not the running of hospita\n- ls itself) is funded by means of so called \"Social insurance contributions\" accounting for approx. 24% of the salary, they are therefore no taxes as such. 7% of\n- \" the contribution is reserved for health coverage in one of Austria\'s 22 public insurances, but cannot exceed EUR 281,- monthly (USD 399,-). Depending on the jo\"\n- b, somebody will be insured at one of the 9 state-run territorial health funds or at job specific insurances, e.g. public employees or farmers have their own (c\n- ompulsory) health insurance. 22 public insurances for 8 million people is subject to violent criticism, as tremendous savings could be reached by unifying the i\n- nsurances to one centralized provider. However, no Austrian state is willing to give up its own public insurances as it is sphere of action for electoral campai\n- gns. The operation of hospitals is not paid by social contributions, but by taxes. This means that general health coverage adds up to much more and is therefore\n- \" more expensive as often depicted. Austria spends approx. 10% of its GDP for health coverage.\\n\\\n [edit] Finland\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in Finland\\n\\\n In Finland, pub\"\n- lic medical services at clinics and hospitals are run by the municipalities (local government) and are funded 76% by taxation, 20% by patients through access ch\n- arges, and 4% by others. Private provision is mainly in the primary care sector. There are a few private hospitals [50]. The main hospitals are either municipal\n- \"ly owned (funded from local taxes) or run by the medical teaching universities (funded jointly by the municipalities and the national government). According to \"\n- \"a survey published by the European Commission in 2000, Finland\'s is in the top 4 of EU countries in terms of satisfaction with their hospital care system: 88% o\"\n- f Finnish respondents were satisfied compared with the EU average of 41.3%.[51] Finnish health care expenditures are below the European average.[citation needed\n- \"] The private medical sector accounts for about 14 percent of total health care spending. Only 8% of doctors choose to work in private practice, and some of the\"\n- |-\n se also choose to do some work in the public sector.[citation needed]\n Taxation funding is partly local and partly nationally based. The national social insuranc\n- e institution KELA reimburses part of patients prescription costs and makes a contribution towards private medical costs (including dentistry) if they choose to\n- \" be treated in the private sector rather than the public sector. Patient access charges are subject to annual caps. For example GP visits cost \\xE2\\x82\\xAC11 per visit w\"\n- \"ith annual \\xE2\\x82\\xAC33 cap; hospital outpatient treatment \\xE2\\x82\\xAC22 per visit; a hospital stay, including food, medical care and medicines \\xE2\\x82\\xAC26 per 24 hours, or \\xE2\\x82\\xAC12 if\"\n- \" in a psychiatric hospital. After a patient has spent \\xE2\\x82\\xAC590 per year on public medical services (including prescription drugs), all treatment and medications t\"\n- |-\n hereafter in that year are free.\n [edit] Germany\n Main article: Health care in Germany\n Germany has the world\'s oldest universal health care system, with origins d\n- \"ating back to Otto von Bismarck\'s Health Insurance Act of 1883.[52] As mandatory health insurance, it originally applied only to low-income workers and certain \"\n- government employees, but has gradually expanded to cover the great majority of the population.[53] The system is decentralized with private practice physicians\n- \" providing ambulatory care, and independent, mostly non-profit hospitals providing the majority of inpatient care. Approximately 92% of the population is covere\"\n- d by a \'Statutory Health Insurance\' plan, which provides a standardized level of coverage through any one of approximately 1100 public or private sickness funds\n- . Standard insurance is funded by a combination of employee contributions, employer contributions and government subsidies on a scale determined by income level\n- . Higher income workers sometimes choose to pay a tax and opt out of the standard plan, in favor of \'private\' insurance. The latter\'s premiums are not linked to\n- \" income level but instead to health status.[54]\\n\\\n Historically, the level of provider reimbursement for specific services is determined through negotiations betwe\"\n- \"en regional physician\'s associations and sickness funds. Since 1976 the government has convened an annual commission, comprised of representatives of business, \"\n- labor, physicians, hospitals, and insurance and pharmaceutical industries.[55] The commission takes into account government policies and makes recommendations t\n- \"o regional associations with respect to overall expenditure targets. In 1986 expenditure caps were implemented and were tied to the age of the local population \"\n- as well as the overall wage increases. Although reimbursement of providers is on a fee-for-service basis the amount to be reimbursed for each service is determi\n- ned retrospectively to ensure that spending targets are not exceeded. Capitated care, such as that provided by U.S. health maintenance organizations, has been c\n- onsidered as a cost containment mechanism but would require consent of regional medical associations, and has not materialized.[56] Copayments were introduced i\n- n the 1980s in an attempt to prevent overutilization and control costs. The average length of hospital stay in Germany has decreased in recent years from 14 day\n- s to 9 days, still considerably longer than average stays in the U.S. (5 to 6 days).[57][58] The difference is partly driven by the fact that hospital reimburse\n- ment is chiefly a function of the number of hospital days as opposed to procedures or the patient\'s diagnosis. Drug costs have increased substantially, rising n\n- \"early 60% from 1991 through 2005. Despite attempts to contain costs, overall health care expenditures rose to 10.7% of GDP in 2005, comparable to other western \"\n- |-\n European nations, but substantially less than that spent in the U.S. (nearly 16% of GDP).[59]\n [edit] Ireland\n Main article: Health care in Ireland\n The public hea\n- \"lth care system of the Republic of Ireland is governed by the Health Act 2004, which established a new body to be responsible for providing health and personal \"\n- social services to everyone living in Ireland - the Health Service Executive. The new national health service came into being officially on 1 January 2005; howe\n- ver the new structures are currently in the process of being established as the reform programme continues. In addition to the public-sector, there is also a la\n- |-\n rge private healthcare market.\n [edit] Netherlands\n Main article: Health care in the Netherlands\n The Netherlands has a dual-level system. All primary and curative\n- \" care (i.e. the family doctor service and hospitals and clinics) is financed from private compulsory insurance. Long term care for the elderly, the dying, the l\"\n- ong term mentally ill etc. is covered by social insurance funded from taxation. According to the WHO, the health care system in the Netherlands was 62% governme\n- |-\n nt funded and 38% privately funded as of 2004.[38]\n Insurance companies must offer a core universal insurance package for the universal primary, curative care wh\n- ich includes the cost of all prescription medicines. They must do this at a fixed price for all. The same premium is paid whether young or old, healthy or sick.\n- \" It is illegal in The Netherlands for insurers to refuse an application for health insurance, to impose special conditions (e.g. exclusions, deductibles, co-pay\"\n- \"s etc or refuse to fund treatments which a doctor has determined to be medically necessary). The system is 50% financed from payroll taxes paid by employers to \"\n- \"a fund controlled by the Health regulator. The government contributes an additional 5% to the regulator\'s fund. The remaining 45% is collected as premiums paid \"\n- by the insured directly to the insurance company. Some employers negotiate bulk deals with health insurers and some even pay the employees\' premiums as an emplo\n- yment benefit). All insurance companies receive additional funding from the regulator\'s fund. The regulator has sight of the claims made by policyholders and th\n- \"erefore can redistribute the funds its holds on the basis of relative claims made by policy holders. Thus insurers with high payouts will receive more from the \"\n- regulator than those with low payouts. Thus insurance companies have no incentive to deter high cost individuals from taking insurance and are compensated if th\n- ey have to pay out more than might be expected. Insurance companies compete with each other on price for the 45% direct premium part of the funding and try to n\n- \"egotiate deals with hospitals to keep costs low and quality high. The competition regulator is charged with checking for abuse of dominant market positions and \"\n- the creation of cartels that act against the consumer interests. An insurance regulator ensures that all basic policies have identical coverage rules so that no\n- \" person is medically disadvantaged by his or her choice of insurer.\\n\\\n Hospitals in the Netherlands are also regulated and inspected but are mostly privately run a\"\n- nd for profit, as are many of the insurance companies. Patients can choose where they want to be treated and have access to information on the internet about th\n- e performance and waiting times at each hospital. Patients dissatisfied with their insurer and choice of hospital can cancel at any time but must make a new agr\n- |-\n eement with another insurer.\n Insurance companies can offer additional services at extra cost over and above the universal system laid down by the regulator, e.g\n- \". for dental care. The standard monthly premium for health care paid by individual adults is about \\xE2\\x82\\xAC100 per month. Persons on low incomes can get assistance f\"\n- rom the government if they cannot afford these payments. Children under 18 are insured by the system at no additional cost to them or their families because the\n- \" insurance company receives the cost of this from the regulator\'s fund.\\n\\\n [edit] United Kingdom\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in the United Kingdom\\n\\\n Each of the Countri\"\n- \"es of the United Kingdom has a National Health Service that provides public healthcare to all UK permanent residents that is free at the point of need and paid \"\n- for from general taxation. However, since Health is a devolved matter, considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries.[60]\n- |-\n \n [edit] England\n Main article: Healthcare in England\n The National Health Service (NHS), created by the National Health Service Act 1946 has provided the majority\n- \" of healthcare in England since its launch on 5 July 1948.\\n\\\n The NHS Constitution for England documents at high level, the objectives of the NHS, the legal rights\"\n- \" and responsibilities of the various parties (patients, staff, NHS trust boards) and the guiding principles which govern the service.[61] The NHS constitution m\"\n- \"akes it clear that it provides a comprehensive service, available to all irrespective of age, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, religion or belief; \"\n- \"that access to NHS services is based on clinical need and not an individual\\xE2\\x80\\x99s ability to pay; and that care is never refused on unreasonable grounds. Patient \"\n- choice in terms of doctor, care, treatments and place of treatment is an important aspect of the NHS\'s ambition, and in some cases patients can elect for treatm\n- ent in other European countries at the NHS\'s expense. Wait times are low, with most people able to see their primary care doctor on the same day or the followin\n- g day[62] and only 36.1% of hospital admissions are from a waiting list, with the remainder being either emergencies admitted immediately or else pre-booked adm\n- issions or similar (e.g. child birth) [63]. No patient should experience a delay of more than 18 weeks from initial hospital referral to final treatment[64]. Th\n- |-\n is includes the time for all investigative tests and consultations, and two thirds of patients are currently treated in under 12 weeks.[65]\n Although centrally f\n- \"unded there is no large central bureaucracy to manage it. Responsibility is highly devolved to geographical areas through Strategic Health Authorities and even \"\n- more locally through NHS primary care trusts , NHS hospital trusts and increasingly to NHS foundation trusts which are providing even more decentralized service\n- s within the NHS framework, with more decision making taken by local people, patients and staff. The central government office, the Department of Health, is not\n- \" involved in day to day decision making in either the Strategic Health Authorities or the individual local trusts (primarily health, hospital or ambulance) or t\"\n- he national specialist trusts such as NHS Blood and Transplant, but it does lay down general guidelines for them to follow. Local trusts are accountable to thei\n- |-\n r local populations, whilst government ministers are accountable to Parliament for the service overall.\n The NHS provides, among other things, primary care, in-p\n- \"atient care, long-term healthcare, psychiatric care and treatments ophthalmology and dentistry. All treatment is free with the exception of certain charges for \"\n- prescriptions, dentistry and ophthalmology (which themselves are free to children, the elderly, the unemployed and those on low incomes). Eighty-nine percent of\n- \" NHS prescriptions are obtained free of charge, mosly children, pensioners and pregnat women. Others pay a flat rate of \\xC2\\xA37.20[66], and others may cap their ann\"\n- ual charges. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance. Private insurance accounts for only 4 percent of heal\n- th expenditure and covers little more than a tenth of the population. [67]. Private insurers in the UK only cover acute care from specialists. They do not cover\n- \" generalist consultations, pre-existing conditions, medical emergencies, organ transplants, chronic conditions such as diabetes or conditions such as pregnancy \"\n- or HIV. [68] Most NHS general practitioners are private doctors who contract to provide NHS services but most hospitals are publicly owned and run through NHS T\n- rusts. A few NHS medical services such as \"surgicentres\") are sub-contracted to private providers [69] as are some non-medical services (such as catering). Some\n- \" capital projects such as new hospitals have been funded through the Private Finance Initiative, enabling investment without excessive strain on the public sect\"\n- |-\n or borrowing requirement.\n [edit] Northern Ireland\n Main article: Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland\n Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland is the des\n- |-\n ignation of the national public health service in Northern Ireland.\n [edit] Scotland\n Main article: Healthcare in Scotland\n NHS Scotland, created by the National H\n- ealth Service (Scotland) Act 1947, was also launched on 5 July 1948 though it has always been a separate organisation. Since devolution, NHS Scotland follows th\n- |-\n e policies and priorities of the Scottish Government, including the phasing out of all prescription charges by 2011.\n [edit] Wales\n Main article: Healthcare in Wa\n- |-\n les\n NHS Wales was originally formed as part of the same NHS structure created by the National Health Service Act 1946 but powers over the NHS in Wales came unde\n- |-\n r the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969[70], in turn being transferred under devolution to what is now the Welsh Assembly Government.\n [edit] Oceania\n [edit] A\n- \"ustralia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Medicare\'s logo\\n\\n\\n\\\n Main article: Medicare (Australia)\\n\\\n In Australia, Medibank \\xE2\\x80\\x94 as it was then known \\xE2\\x80\\x94 was introduced, by the Whitlam Labor gover\"\n- nment on 1 July 1975, through the Health Insurance Act 1973. The Australian Senate rejected the changes multiple times and they were passed only after a joint s\n- itting after the 1974 double dissolution election. However, Medibank was supported by the subsequent Fraser Coalition (Australia) government and became a key fe\n- \"ature of Australia\\xE2\\x80\\x99s public policy landscape. The exact structure of Medibank/Medicare, in terms of the size of the rebate to doctors and hospitals and the wa\"\n- y it has administered, has varied over the years. The original Medibank program proposed a 1.35% levy (with low income exemptions) but these bills were rejected\n- \" by the Senate, and so Medibank was funded from general taxation. In 1976, the Fraser Government introduced a 2.5% levy and split Medibank in two: a universal s\"\n- |-\n cheme called Medibank Public and a government-owned private health insurance company, Medibank Private.\n During the 1980s, Medibank Public was renamed Medicare b\n- y the Hawke Labor government, which also changed the funding model, to an income tax surcharge, known as the Medicare Levy, which was set at 1.5%, with exemptio\n- ns for low income earners.[71] The Howard Coalition government introduced an additional levy of 1.0%, known as the Medicare Levy Surcharge, for those on high an\n- nual incomes ($70,000) and do not have adequate levels of private hospital coverage.[72] This was part of an effort by the Coalition to encourage take-up of pri\n- vate health insurance. According to WHO, government funding covered 67.5% of Australia\'s health care expenditures in 2004; private sources covered the remaining\n- \" 32.5% of expenditures.[38]\\n\\\n [edit] New Zealand\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in New Zealand\\n\\\n As with Australia, New Zealand\'s healthcare system is funded through gen\"\n- eral taxation. According to the WHO, government sources covered 77.4% of New Zealand\'s health care costs in 2004; private expenditures covered the remaining 22.\n- |-\n 6%.[38]\n [edit] Economics\n Main article: Health care economics\n [edit] Funding models\n Universal health care in most countries has been achieved by a mixed model of\n- \" funding. General taxation revenue is the primary source of funding, but in many countries it is supplemented by specific levies (which may be charged to the in\"\n- dividual and/or an employer) or with the option of private payments (either direct or via optional insurance) for services beyond that covered by the public sys\n- |-\n tem.\n Almost all European systems are financed through a mix of public and private contributions.[73] The majority of universal health care systems are funded pr\n- imarily by tax revenue (e.g. Portugal[73] and Spain). Some nations, such as Germany, France[49] and Japan[74] employ a multi-payer system in which health care i\n- s funded by private and public contributions. However, much of the non-government funding is by defined contributions by employers and employees to regulated no\n- |-\n n-profit sickness funds. These contributions are compulsory and vary according to a person\'s salary, and are effectively a form of hypothecated taxation.\n A dist\n- inction is also made between municipal and national healthcare funding. For example, one model is that the bulk of the healthcare is funded by the municipality,\n- \" speciality healthcare is provided and possibly funded by a larger entity, such as a municipal co-operation board or the state, and the medications are paid by \"\n- |-\n a state agency.\n Universal health care systems are modestly redistributive. Progressivity of health care financing has limited implications for overall income in\n- |-\n equality.[75]\n [edit] Single-payer\n Main article: Single-payer health care\n The term single-payer health care is used in the United States to describe a funding me\n- chanism meeting the costs of medical care from a single fund. Although the fund holder is usually the government, some forms of single-payer employ a public-pri\n- |-\n vate system.\n [edit] Public\n Some countries (notably the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain) have eliminated insurance entirely and choose to fund health care direct\n- ly from taxation. Other countries with insurance-based systems effectively meet the cost of insuring those unable to insure themselves via social security arran\n- |\n gements funded from taxation, either by directly paying their medical bills or by paying for insurance premiums for those affected.\n [edit] Compulsory insurance\n\n- This is usually enforced via legislation requiring residents to purchase insurance, though sometimes, in effect, the government provides the insurance. Sometime\n- s there may be a choice of multiple public and private funds providing a standard service (e.g. as in Germany) or sometimes just a single public fund (as in Can\n- |-\n ada).\n In some European countries where there is private insurance and universal health care, such as Germany, Belgium, and The Netherlands, the problem of adver\n- se selection (see Private insurance below) is overcome using a risk compensation pool to equalize, as far as possible, the risks between funds. Thus a fund with\n- \" a predominantly healthy, younger population has to pay into a compensation pool and a fund with an older and predominantly less healthy population would receiv\"\n- e funds from the pool. In this way, sickness funds compete on price and there is no advantage to eliminate people with higher risks because they are compensated\n- \" for by means of risk-adjusted capitation payments. Funds are not allowed to pick and choose their policyholders or deny coverage, but then mainly compete on pr\"\n- |-\n ice and service. In some countries the basic coverage level is set by the government and cannot be modified.[76]\n Ireland at one time had a \"community rating\" sy\n- \"stem through VHI, effectively a single-payer or common risk pool. The government later opened VHI to competition but without a compensation pool. This resulted \"\n- in foreign insurance companies entering the Irish market and offering cheap health insurance to relatively healthy segments of the market which then made higher\n- \" profits at VHI\'s expense. The government later re-introduced community rating through a pooling arrangement and at least one main major insurance company, BUPA\"\n- \", then withdrew from the Irish market.\\n\\\n [edit] Private insurance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n This article may be inaccurate in or unbalanced towards certain viewpoints. Please improve \"\n- |-\n the article by adding information on neglected viewpoints, or discuss the issue on the talk page. (June 2009)\n \n \n In some countries with universal coverage, priva\n- te insurance often excludes many health conditions which are expensive and which the state health care system can provide. For example in the UK, one of the lar\n- |-\n gest private health care providers is BUPA which has the following list of general exclusions[77].\n Dental/oral treatment (such as fillings, gum disease, jaw shr\n- \"inkage, etc)\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; pregnancy and childbirth\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; temporary relief of symptoms\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; convalescence, rehabilitation and general nursing care\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; drugs and dressings fo\"\n- \"r out-patient or take-home use\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; screening and preventive treatment; birth control, conception, sexual problems and sex changes\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; allergies or allergic diso\"\n- \"rders; chronic conditions\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; eyesight\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; physical aids and devices\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; *deafness; cosmetic, reconstructive or weight loss treatment\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; ageing, menopaus\"\n- \"e and puberty&#160;; dialysis\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; complications from excluded or restricted conditions/ treatment&#160;; HRT and bone densitometry\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; learning difficulti\"\n- \"es, behavioural and developmental problems&#160;; overseas treatment and repatriation&#160;; AIDS/HIV\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; pre-existing or special conditions&#160;; experi\"\n- \"mental drugs and treatment\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; sleep problems and disorders&#160;; speech disorders\\xE2\\x80\\xA0\\n\\\n all of which (except overseas repatriation) are available for free \"\n- \"or very low cost from the NHS. (\\xE2\\x80\\xA0 indicates that treatment may be provided in certain circumstances)\\n\\\n Where voluntary insurance (often private) is predominant,\"\n- \" such as in the U.S., medical (health) insurance is subject to the well-known economic problem of adverse selection which may also be referred to as a market fa\"\n- ilure.[citation needed] Adverse selection in insurance markets occurs because those providing insurance have limited information with which to estimate the heal\n- th risks on which they may need to pay future claims.[citation needed] In simple terms, those with poor health are more likely to apply for insurance and more l\n- ikely to need treatments requiring high insurance company payouts.[citation needed] Those with good health may find the cost of insurance too high for the perce\n- ived benefit, and some will remove themselves from the risk pool.[citation needed] This adverse selection concentrates the risk pool, thereby further raising co\n- sts.[citation needed] In practical terms, the potential for adverse selection means that private insurers have an economic incentive to use medical underwriting\n- \" to \'weed out\' high cost applicants in order to avoid adverse selection.[citation needed] Among the potential solutions posited by economists are single payer s\"\n- ystems as well as other methods of ensuring that health insurance is universal, such as by requiring all citizens to purchase insurance and limiting the ability\n- \" of insurance companies to deny insurance to individuals or vary price between individuals.[78][79]\\n\\n\\\n [edit] See also\\n\\n\\\n Health care compared - tabular comparisons\"\n- \" of the US, Canada, and other countries not shown above.\\n\\\n Health care reform debate in the United States\\n\\\n Health insurance cooperative\\n\\\n Millennium Development Goal\"\n- |-\n s\n National health insurance\n Publicly-funded health care\n Single-payer health care\n \n [edit] References\n \n \n ^ a b Insuring America\'s Health: Principles and Recommenda\n- |-\n tions, Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science, 2004-01-14\n ^ \"Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Questions and Answers\" (PDF).

The term has a history of scholarly debate surrounding its precise meaning, but a castle is usually considered to be the \"private fortif\n- ied residence\" of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a fortress, which was not a home, or a fortified town, which was a public defence. Over the extended pe\n- riod of time that castles were built they took on a great many forms with many different features, but some, such as the curtain wall and arrow slits, were comm\n- |-\n onplace.\n Castles originated in the 9th&#160;and 10th&#160;centuries, when the fall of the Carolingian Empire in Europe and the rise of feudal society led to the\n- \" territory of the collapsing empire being divided between individual lords and princes, and an emphasis on personal defence. Castles controlled their immediate \"\n- areas, and were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as protection from an enemy. Although t\n- \"heir military origins are often emphasised, castles also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local \"\n- |-\n populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near elements such as a mill, integral to life in the community.\n Many castles were o\n- riginally built from earth and timber, and had their defences replaced later by stone equivalents. In the late 12th&#160;and early 13th&#160;century, a scientif\n- ic approach to castle defence emerged. Towers proliferated, with an emphasis on flanking fire, and many new castles were polygonal, while previously they had re\n- \"lied more on the lay of the land and were curvilinear, or relied on concentric defence&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 several stages of defence within each other that could all funct\"\n- ion at the same time, thereby maximising the castle\'s firepower. The origin of these changes in defence has been attributed to a mixture of influence from the C\n- \"rusades&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 where castle technology was advanced such as the new type of concentric fortification&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and drawing on earlier defences such as Roman fo\"\n- rts for inspiration. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, and devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defen\n- |-\n ce into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress, and to dominate their landscape.\n Gunpowder, introduced to Europe i\n- n the 14th&#160;century, did not have an immediate impact on castle building. Castles do not show adaptation to resist bombardment by cannons until the 15th&#16\n- \"0;century, when artillery became powerful enough to break down walls. Although castles were built across Europe well into the 16th&#160;century, new techniques \"\n- to deal with improved cannon eventually led to them becoming uncomfortable and undesirable places to live, and so true castles went into decline, replaced by ar\n- tillery forts with no role in administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18th&#160;century onwards, there was a renewed interest in cas\n- |-\n tles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no defensive purpose.\n \n \n \n \n Contents\n \n \n 1 Definition\n \n 1\n- |-\n .1 Etymology\n 1.2 Defining characteristics\n \n \n 2 Common features\n \n 2.1 Motte\n 2.2 Bailey and enceinte\n 2.3 Keep\n 2.4 Curtain wall\n 2.5 Moat\n 2.6 Gatehouse\n 2.7 Other feat\n- |+\n ures\n \n \n 3 History\n \n 3.1 Antecedents\n 3.2 Origins and early castles\n 3.3 Innovation and scientific design\n 3.4 Advent of gunpowder\n 3.5 Later use and revival castles\n \n- |-\n \n 4 Construction\n 5 Social centre\n 6 Castle landscapes\n 7 Warfare\n 8 See also\n 9 References\n 10 Further reading\n 11 External links\n \n \n \n \n \n //<![CDATA[\n if (window.showTocTo\n- |-\n ggle) { var tocShowText = \"show\"; var tocHideText = \"hide\"; showTocToggle(); } \n //]]>\n \n [edit] Definition\n [edit] Etymology\n \n \n \n \n The Norman \"White Tower\", the keep\n- \" of the Tower of London, exemplifies all uses of a castle: city defence, a residence, and a place of refuge in times of crisis.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Castle is derived from the Lat\"\n- \"in word castellum. This is a diminutive of the word castrum, which means \\\"fortified place\\\". The Old English castel, French ch\\xC3\\xA2teau, Spanish castillo, Italian c\"\n- \"astello, as well as other European words for castle derive from castellum.[2] The word castle was introduced into English shortly before the Norman Conquest to \"\n- denote this type of building, then new to England, introduced to the country by Normans working for Edward the Confessor.[3] Although the various terms used for\n- \" castles in Europe derive from the same root, they are not universally applied to the same types of structures. The French ch\\xC3\\xA2teau is used to describe a grand \"\n- \"country house at the heart of an estate, regardless of the presence of fortifications.[4]\\n\\\n [edit] Defining characteristics\\n\\\n In its simplest terms, the definition \"\n- of a castle accepted amongst academics is \"a private fortified residence\".[5] This contrasts with earlier fortifications, such as Anglo Saxon burhs and walled c\n- \"ities such as Constantinople and Antioch in the Middle East: castles were not communal defences but were built and owned by the local feudal lord, either for th\"\n- emselves of for their monarch.[6] In the late 20th&#160;century, there was a trend to refine the definition of a castle by including the criterion of feudal own\n- ership, thus tying castles to the medieval period. However this does not necessarily reflect what medieval people called castles. During the First Crusade (1096\n- \"\\xE2\\x80\\x931099) the Frankish armies encountered walled settlements and forts that they indiscriminately called castles, but would not be considered such under the mode\"\n- |-\n rn definition.[5]\n \n \n \n \n Windsor Castle in England was first built as a fortification of the Norman Conquest, and today is home to Queen Elizabeth II of the United\n- \" Kingdom.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Castles served a range of purposes, the most important of which were military, administrative, and domestic. Early castles were primarily military i\"\n- \"nstitutions, places of protection from an enemy. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which could be used as a base of operations \"\n- in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England as both defensive and offensive tools to pacify the inhabitants.[7] As William the Co\n- nqueror advanced through England after the Norman Conquest in 1066, he fortifed key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087 he establis\n- hed 36&#160;castles such as Warwick Castle, which was used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.[8][9] However, a recent trend to view castles les\n- s as military institutions and more as social structures has questioned the current definition. During the Middle Ages, castles tended to lose their military si\n- |-\n gnificance and became more important as residences and statements of power.[10]\n In Britain the term \"castle\" has also been erroneously used to refer to Iron Age\n- \" fortifications such as Maiden Castle, Dorset.[11] A castle was not only a bastion and prison but also a place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers.\"\n- \" Over time the aesthetics of the design became more important, as the castle\'s appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant. Cast\"\n- les were built as defensive measures and offensive weapons, but comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls. Although castles still prov\n- |-\n ided protection from low levels of violence in later periods, eventually they were succeeded by country houses as high status residences.[12]\n [edit] Common feat\n- \"ures\\n\\\n [edit] Motte\\n\\\n Main article: Motte-and-bailey\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The wooden palisades surmounting mottes were often later replaced in stone, as in this example at Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau \"\n- |-\n de Gisors in France.\n \n \n A motte was a mound with a flat top. The mounds were often artificial, although sometimes they incorporated a pre-existing feature of the\n- \" landscape. The excavation of earth for the mound would leave a ditch around the motte, which acted as a further defence. Sometimes a nearby stream would be div\"\n- erted to flood the ditch, creating a moat. Motte and moat derive from the same Old French word, indicating that they were originally associated features and dep\n- \"ended on each other for their construction. Although the motte is usually associated with the bailey to form a motte-and-bailey castle, this was not always the \"\n- \"case and there are instances where a motte existed on its own. \\\"Motte\\\" refers to the mound alone, but it was often surmounted by a fortified structure, such as \"\n- a keep, and the flat top would be surrounded by a palisade.[13] The motte was accessed by a flying bridge as represented by the Bayeux Tapestry\'s depiction of C\n- \"h\\xC3\\xA2teau de Dinan.[14] Sometimes a motte covered an older castle or hall, whose rooms now became underground storage areas and prisons beneath a new donjon.[15]\\n\"\n- |-\n [edit] Bailey and enceinte\n Main article: Enceinte\n A bailey, also called a ward, was a fortified enclosure. They were a common feature of castles, and most had a\n- t least one. The keep on top of the motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home of t\n- \"he rest of the lord\'s household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities could all be expected to be \"\n- \"found in the bailey. There was a progression for lords to build more comfortable accommodation for themselves within the bailey, which resulted in the creation \"\n- of another bailey that separated the high status buildings such as the lord\'s chambers and the chapel, from the everyday structures such as the workshops and ba\n- rracks.[16] Although often associated with the motte-and-bailey type of castle, baileys could be found as independent defensive structures. These simple fortifi\n- cations were called ringworks.[17] The terms bailey and enceinte are linked, as the enceinte was the castle\'s main defensive enclosure. A castle could have seve\n- ral baileys but only one enceinte. Castles with no keep and which relied on their outer defences for protection are sometimes called enceinte castles;[18] these\n- \" were the earliest form of castles, before the donjon arrived in the 10th century.[19]\\n\\\n [edit] Keep\\n\\\n Main article: Keep\\n\\\n A keep was a great tower and usually the s\"\n- \"trongest point of a castle before the introduction of concentric defence. Keep was not a term used in the medieval period&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the term was applied from the\"\n- \" 16th&#160;century onwards&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and donjon was used to refer to great towers,[20] or turris in Latin. Dungeon is a corrupted form of donjon and means a dark\"\n- \", unwelcoming prison.[21] Although often the strongest part of a castle and a last place of refuge if the outer defences fell, the keep was not left empty in ca\"\n- se of attack but was used as a residence by the lord who owned the castle, or his guests or representatives.[22] Initially this was only the usual pattern in En\n- gland, when after the Norman Conquest of 1066 the \"conquerors lived for a long time in a constant state of alert\"; elsewhere the lord\'s wife presided over a sep\n- \"arate residence (domus, aula or mansio in Latin) close to the keep, and the donjon was a barracks and headquarters. Gradually the two functions merged into the \"\n- same building; for many examples choosing the appropriate term can be difficult, and the highest residential storeys have large windows.[23] In motte-and-bailey\n- \" castles, the keep was on top of the motte.[13]\\n\\\n [edit] Curtain wall\\n\\\n Main article: Curtain wall (fortification)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Carcassonne, France, showing the classic feat\"\n- |-\n ures of the curtain walls, defensive ditch with arched bridge, and cylindrical flanking towers, with a gatehouse and additional wooden defensive structures.\n \n \n C\n- \"urtain walls were defensive walls enclosing a bailey. They had to be high enough to make scaling the walls with ladders difficult and thick enough to withstand \"\n- bombardment from siege engines which from the 15th&#160;century onwards included artillery. A typical wall could be 3&#160;m (9.8&#160;ft) wide and 12&#160;m (3\n- \"9&#160;ft) tall, although sizes varied greatly between castles. To protect them from undermining, curtain walls were sometimes given a stone skirt around their \"\n- base. Walkways along the tops of the curtain walls allowed defenders to rain missiles on enemies from above, and battlements gave them further protection. Curta\n- in walls would be studded with towers to allow enfilading fire along the wall.[24] Arrow slits in the walls did not become common in Europe until the 13th&#160;\n- |-\n century, for fear that they might compromise the wall\'s strength.[25]\n [edit] Moat\n Main article: Moat\n A moat was a defensive ditch with steep sides, and could be\n- \" either water-filled or dry. Its purpose was to stop engines such as siege towers from reaching the curtain wall and to prevent the walls from being undermined.\"\n- \" Water moats are found in low lying areas. Moats were often crossed by a drawbridge, although these were often replaced by stone bridges. The moat around Flint \"\n- \"Castle in Wales needed 1,800&#160;excavators to build. Fortified islands could be added to the moat, adding another layer of defence. Water defences, including \"\n- moats as well as natural lakes, had the benefit of dictating the enemy\'s approach to the castle.[26] The 13th-century Caerphilly Castle, also in Wales, has some\n- \" of the largest water defences in Western Europe, on a site covering over 30&#160;acres (120,000&#160;m2), created by flooding the valley to the south of the ca\"\n- |-\n stle.[27]\n [edit] Gatehouse\n Main article: Gatehouse\n An undeveloped entrance is the weakest part in a circuit of defences. To overcome this, the gatehouse was dev\n- eloped, allowing those inside the castle to control the flow of traffic. In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in\n- \" stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot, so to allow the defenders to see the gate without exposing themselves projecting towers were added on each si\"\n- de of the gate, in a style similar to that developed by the Romans.[28] Contained within the building would be a series of defences to make a direct assault mor\n- \"e difficult than battering down a simple gate. There would be one or more portcullis&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 a wooden grille reinforced with metal to block a passage&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 \"\n- and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry an enemy. The passage through the gatehouse would have been lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant ha\n- \"d to spend being shot at in a confined space.[29] It is a popular myth that so-called murder-holes&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 openings in the roof of the gateway passge&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 \"\n- were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead, and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was completel\n- y impractical. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, similar to machicolations or to pour water to extinguish fires.[30] Provision was made i\n- n the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation, so the gate was never left undefended, although this evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of\n- \" defence.[31] The entrance to a castle could be further elaborated through the addition of a barbican. This consisted of a rampart and ditch in front of the gat\"\n- ehouse.[32] Developed in the 13th and 14th centuries,[33] it could also include a tower. The purpose of a barbican was not just to provide another line of defen\n- |-\n ce but to dictate the only approach to the gate.[34]\n [edit] Other features\n Battlements were most often found surmounting curtain walls, although also on the top\n- s of gatehouses, and comprised several elements; crenellations, hoardings and machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating\n- \" crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks on top of a wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at or\"\n- \" drop objects on attackers at the base of the wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Ma\"\n- chicolations were stone openings in the top of the wall that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base off the wall in a similar fashion to hoarding\n- s.[35] Arrowslits, also commonly called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts to be fired on attack\n- ers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but the size of the opening could also impede the defender if it w\n- \"as too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming.[36]\\n\\\n [edit] History\\n\\\n [edit] Antecedents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Ambleside Roman \"\n- |-\n fort, England\n \n \n Historian Charles Coulson states that the accumulation of wealth and resources such as food in ancient societies led to the need for defensive s\n- \"tructures. The earliest fortifications originate from the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. \"\n- \"Northern Europe was slower than the east to develop defensive structures and it was not until the Bronze Age that hill forts were developed, which proliferated \"\n- across Europe in the Iron Age. They differed to their eastern counterparts through the use of earthworks rather than stone as a building material.[37] Many eart\n- hworks survive today, along with evidence of palisades to accompany the ditches. In Europe, oppida emerged in the 2nd&#160;century BC; they were densely inhabit\n- ed fortified settlements, such as the oppidum of Manching, and developed from hill forts.[38] The Romans encountered fortified settlements such as hill forts an\n- \"d oppida when expanding their territory into northern Europe.[38] Although primitive, they were often effective, and required extensive siege engines and other \"\n- siege warfare techniques to overcome, such as at the Battle of Alesia. The Romans\' own fortifications (castra) varied from simple temporary earthworks thrown up\n- \" by armies on the move, to elaborate permanent stone constructions, notably the milecastles of Hadrian\'s Wall. Roman forts were generally rectangular with round\"\n- \"ed corners \\xE2\\x80\\x93 a \\\"playing-card shape\\\".[39]\\n\\\n [edit] Origins and early castles\\n\\\n Like the feudal society they were part of, castles had their origins in the 9th&#160\"\n- ;and 10th&#160;centuries. This period saw the emergence of a social and military elite in the Carolingian Empire and the development of mounted fighting. Fighti\n- ng on horseback was a costly and time consuming endeavour, requiring specialised equipment and trained horses, and for their efforts these early knights were gr\n- anted land by the lords for whom they fought. The link between knight and lord was the basis of feudalism, and could go higher up the social scale with loyaltie\n- s between lords, dukes, princes, and kings. When the Carolingian Empire collapsed in the 9th&#160;and 10th&#160;centuries, it took with it effective centralised\n- \" administration,[40] and it fell to the landed elite to take over control. This led to the privatisation of government, with local lords taking on the responsib\"\n- ility for the local economy and justice. Although castles were private buildings, lordship was a public office and the holder had a responsibility to protect hi\n- s peasants.[41] There is a traditional view that feudalism was a tool of social disintegration that contributed to the downfall of the Carolingian Empire, howev\n- er modern academic opinion is that it was a successor to previous government rather than a rival.[42] Castles sometimes required the permission of the king or o\n- ther high authority. Charles the Bald prohibited the construction of castles without his permission and ordered them destroyed; this could be the earliest refer\n- ence to castles being built without permission, breaking the feudal agreement between lord and vassal, however there are very few castles dated with certainty f\n- \"rom the mid-9th&#160;century. Converted into a donjon in around 950, Dou\\xC3\\xA9-la-Fontaine, in France, is the oldest standing castle in Europe.[43]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n One of the e\"\n- \"arliest representations of a castle from the Bayeux Tapestry. It depicts attackers of Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Dinan in France using fire, one of the threats to wooden castl\"\n- \"es.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Military historian Allen Brown asserts that in the absence of a working state and the breakdown of society associated with the decline of the Carolingian \"\n- \"Empire, feudal ties became more important. The rise of castles is not solely attributed to defence of the new feudal lords\\xE2\\x80\\x99 lands, but as a reaction to attack\"\n- s by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings.[40] It is likely that the castle evolved from the practice of fortifying a lordly home. In a time of social unrest, a lord w\n- \"ould wish to protect his home or hall, and the greatest threat was that of fire as they were usually wooden. To protect against this, and keep other threats at \"\n- \"bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an \"\n- artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers.[44] While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is an\n- cient, raising a motte to exploit the advantages of height is a medieval innovation.[45] A bank and ditch enclosure was a simple form of defence, and when found\n- \" without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enh\"\n- anced by the addition a stone curtain wall.[46] Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door.\n- \" This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 to make it harder to throw objects in&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and to change the entrance from ground floor to\"\n- \" first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls and contained the lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s household.[4\"\n- \"7] Castles were not just used as defensive sites, but to enhance a lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area,[4\"\n- |-\n 8] and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.[49]\n References to castles in texts such as charters from 1000 onwards i\n- ncreased greatly. Historians have interpreted this as evidence of a sudden increase in the number of castles in Europe around this time; their interpretation ha\n- s been supported by archaeologists dating the construction of castle sites through the examination of ceramics.[50] The increase in Italy began in the 950s, wit\n- h numbers of castles increasing by a factor of three to five every 50&#160;years, whereas other parts of Europe such as France and Spain were slower. In 950, Pr\n- ovence was home to 12&#160;castles, by 1000 this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100.[51] Despite the common period in which castles rose to pro\n- \"minence in Europe, their form and design varied from region to region. In the early 11th&#160;century, the motte&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 an artificial mound surmounted by a pa\"\n- \"lisade and tower&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was the most common form of castle in Europe, aside from Scandinavia.[51] Castles were introduced into England shortly before the Norm\"\n- \"an Conquest in 1066.[52] The motte and bailey&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 a motte with an outer enclosure&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 remained the dominant form of castle in England, Wales, and Irel\"\n- |-\n and well into the 12th&#160;century.[53] At the same time, castle architecture in mainland Europe became more sophisticated.[54]\n \n \n \n \n Built in 1138, Castle Risin\n- \"g in England is an example of an elaborate donjon.[55]\\n\\n\\n\\\n The donjon&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 or great tower[56]&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was at the centre of this change in castle architecture\"\n- \" in the 12th&#160;century. Central towers proliferated, and typically had a square plan, with walls 3 to 4&#160;m (9.8 to 13&#160;ft) thick. Their decoration em\"\n- ulated Romanesque architecture, and sometimes incorporated double windows similar to those found in church bell towers. Donjons, which were the residence of the\n- \" lord of the castle, evolved to become more spacious. The changes in design changed from utilitarian to decorative to impose upon the landscape as a symbol of l\"\n- ordly power, sometimes compromising defence for the sake of display.[54] Historians have interpreted the widespread presence of castles across Europe in the 11t\n- |-\n h&#160;and 12th&#160;centuries as evidence that warfare was common, and usually between local lords.[57]\n In some countries, it was necessary to obtain the permi\n- ssion of the king through a licence to crenellate, or else the builder risked it being slighted. This was not universal, as in some countries, the monarch had l\n- \"ittle control over lords, or required the construction of new castles to aid in securing the land&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 as was the case in England after 1066 and the Holy La\"\n- \"nd during the Crusades&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 so was unconcerned about granting permission. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built cast\"\n- les, and as a result there are 4,000 in the country. Before the 12th&#160;century, castles were as uncommon in Denmark as they had been in England before the No\n- |-\n rman Conquest. The introduction of castles to Denmark was a reaction to attacks from Wendish pirates, and they were usually intended as coastal defences.[58]\n [e\n- \"dit] Innovation and scientific design\\n\\\n Until the 12th century, stone-built and earth and timber castles were contemporary,[59] but by the late 12th&#160;century \"\n- the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly attributed to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of t\n- imber and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone.[60] Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork\n- \" castles were by no means useless.[61] This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; at the s\"\n- \"tart of the 15th&#160;century Owain Glynd\\xC5\\xB5r\\xE2\\x80\\x99s castle at Sycharth, founded in the late 11th&#160;century, was a timber structure.[62][63]\\n\\\n In the late 12th&#16\"\n- 0;century, there was an obvious change in castle architecture. Until then, castles probably had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrows\n- lits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the lay of the land, and the resu\n- lt was often irregular or curvilinear. The design of castles was of course not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the m\n- id-12th&#160;century.[64] By the end of the 12th&#160;century or the early 13th&#160;century, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in sh\n- ape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level t\n- o allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall. These later castles would not always have a keep, but this may have been because the more compl\n- \"ex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers provided space for habitation to make up for the \"\n- loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to t\n- \"he castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 although there was great variety in the styles of g\"\n- \"ateway and entrances&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and one or more portcullis.[65]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The gatehouse to the inner ward of Beeston Castle, England, was built in the 1220s and has an \"\n- |-\n entrance between two half-round towers.[66]\n \n \n When seeking to explain this change in the complexity and style of castles, antiquarians found their answer in the\n- \" Crusades. It seemed logical that the Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architectu\"\n- \"re. There were legends such as that of Lalys&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 an architect from Palestine who reputedly went to Wales after the Crusades and greatly enhanced the castle\"\n- \"s in the south of the country&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and it was assumed that great architects such as James of Saint George originated in the East. However, in the mid-20th&#\"\n- 160;century this view was cast into doubt. Legends were discredited, and in the case of James of Saint George, it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d\'E\n- \"sp\\xC3\\xA9ranche, in France. If the innovations in fortification had derived from the East, it would have been expected for their influence to be seen from 1100 onwar\"\n- \"ds, immediately after the Christians were victorious in the First Crusade (1096\\xE2\\x80\\x931099), rather than nearly 100&#160;years later.[67] Roman remains in western E\"\n- urope were still upstanding in many places, and as they too featured flanking round-towers, and entrances between two flanking towers. The castle builders of we\n- stern Europe were aware of and influenced by Roman design as demonstrated by the reuse of Saxon shore forts in England, a late Roman innovation despite their na\n- \"me, and in Spain the wall around the city of Avila imitated Roman architecture when it was built in 1091.[67] It has been argued&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 by historian Smail in \"\n- \"Crusading warfare&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 that the case for the influence of eastern fortification on the west has been overstated, and that crusaders of the 12th&#160;century\"\n- \" in fact learnt very little about scientific design from Byzantine and Saracen defences.[68] The explanation for this is that a well sited castle that made use \"\n- of natural defences and had strong ditches and walls had no need for a scientific design. An example of this approach is Karak Castle. Although there were no sc\n- \"ientific elements to its design it was almost impregnable, and in 1187 Saladin chose to lay siege to the castle and starve out its garrison rather than risk an \"\n- |-\n assault.[68]\n After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did not return to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the principality of Antioch, the\n- \" County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their acquisitions were designed mostly by Syrian mas\"\n- \"ter-masons. Their design was very similar to a Roman fort or Byzantine tetrapyrgia: a square curtain wall with towers in each corner, also usually square and no\"\n- t projecting much beyond the curtain wall. In the interior, the keep would have had a square plan and generally be undecorated.[69] While castles were used to h\n- \"old a site and control movement of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified.[70] Castle architecture in the East became more \"\n- \"complex around the late 12th and early 13th&#160;century after the stalemate of the Third Crusade (1189\\xE2\\x80\\x931192). Both Christians and Muslims created fortificati\"\n- ons, and the character of each was different. Saphadin, the 13th-century ruler of the Saracens, created structures with large rectangular towers that influenced\n- \" Muslim architecture and were copied again and again, however they had little influence on Crusader castles.[71]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Krak des Chevaliers is a concentric castle \"\n- \"built with both rectangular and rounded towers. It is amongst the best preserved Crusader castles.[72]\\n\\n\\n\\\n In the early 13th&#160;century, Crusaders castles were \"\n- mostly built by Military Orders, such as the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Knights of the Teutonic Order. They were responsible for the foundation o\n- f sites such as Krak des Chevaliers, Margat, and Belvoir. The forms of the castle varied not just between orders, but individually from castle to castle, althou\n- gh it was common for the castles founded in this period to have concentric defences.[73] The concept, which originated in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, w\n- as to remove the reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be more than one ring of defensive wall, one i\n- nside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If an assailant made it past the first line o\n- \"f defences into the outer enclosure, they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall to secure \"\n- \"the fall of the castle.[74] Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe, for instance when Edward I of England&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 who had himself been on Crusade&\"\n- \"#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 built castles in Wales in the late 13th&#160;century, four of the eight he founded were concentric.[73][74] Not all the features of the Crusader castle\"\n- s from the 13th &amp;nbspcentury were emulated in Europe; for instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the entrance in the side of a tower and for th\n- ere to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this feature to be found in Europe.\n- |-\n [73]\n It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels; something that contemporary builders in Europe were wary o\n- f, believing that they weakened the wall\'s structural integrity. Arrowslits did not compromise the wall\'s strength, but it was not until Edward I\'s programme of\n- \" castle building that they were adopted in Europe.[25] The Crusades also led to the introduction of machicolations into western architecture. Until the 13th&#16\"\n- 0;century, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed\n- \" the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the \"\n- |-\n East long before the arrival of the Crusades, and perhaps as early as the first half of the 8th&#160;century in Syria.[75]\n Although France has been described as\n- \" \\\"the heartland of medieval architecture\\\", the English were at the forefront of castle architecture in the 12th&#160;century. French historian Francois Gebelin \"\n- said:[76] \"The great revival in military architecture was led, as one would naturally expect, by the powerful kings and princes of the time; by the sons of Will\n- iam the Conqueror and their descendants, the Plantagenets, when they became dukes of Normandy. These were the men who built all the most typical twelfth-century\n- \" fortified castles remaining to-day\\\".[77] Despite this, by the beginning of the 15th&#160;century, the rate of castle construction in England and Wales went int\"\n- o decline; the new castles were generally of a lighter build than earlier structures and presented few innovations, although strong sites were still created suc\n- h as that of Raglan in Wales. At the same time, French castle architecture came to the fore and led the way in the field of medieval fortifications. Across Euro\n- \"pe&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 particularly the Baltic, Germany, and Scotland&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 castles were built well into the 16th&#160;century.[78]\\n\\\n [edit] Advent of gunpowder\\n\\\n Artillery\"\n- \" powered by gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns are not recorded until the 1380s and were unpredictable and inaccurate \"\n- \"weapons.[79] Castles were adapted to allow small guns&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 averaging between 19.6 and 22&#160;kg (43 and 49&#160;lb)&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 to fire from towers. These gun\"\n- s were too heavy for a man to carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle on the edge of the gun port he could fire the weapon. The g\n- \"un ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the \"\n- \"timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there \"\n- is an intact example at in Doornenburg Castle in Denmark. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on t\n- |-\n op to allow the gunner to aim.[80]\n \n \n \n \n The rounded walls of Sarzana Castle in Italy are adaptated to gunpowder.\n \n \n This form is very common in castles adapted fo\n- \"r guns, found in Egypt, Italy, Scotland, and Spain, and elsewhere in between. Other types of port, though less common were horizontal slits&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 allowing on\"\n- \"ly lateral movement&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and large square openings, which allowed greater movement.[80] The use of guns for defence gave rise to artillery castles, such as \"\n- \"that of Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Ham in France, Defences against guns was not developed until a later stage.[81] Ham is an example of the trend for new castles to dispense w\"\n- \"ith earlier features such as machicolations, tall towers, and crenellations.[82]\\n\\\n Bigger guns were developed, and in the 15th&#160;century became an alternative \"\n- \"to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages before the advent\"\n- \" of gunpowder&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 were those of a greater range and greater power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made bigger and bigger. By the 1450s\"\n- \" guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mohammed II at the Siege of Constantinople.[83] The response towards more eff\"\n- ective cannons was to build thicker walls than in previous castles and to prefer round towers as the curving sides were more likely to deflect a shot than a fla\n- \"t surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures had to find a way to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled \"\n- behind a castle\'s curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.[84] Often, castles constructed before the age of gunpowder would be incapable of using gun\n- s as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface fo\n- r the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which\n- \" avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle\'s defences. These could be built from earthier earth or stone and were used to mount w\"\n- |-\n eapons.[85]\n Around 1500, the innovation of the angled bastion over curved was developed in Italy.[86] The elite who were responsible for castle construction wer\n- e forced to choose between the new type which could withstand cannon-fire but as a result was ugly and uncomfortable to live in, or to stick with an earlier mor\n- e elaborate style with had more aesthetic appeal and was more of a status symbol. The second choice was more popular, and while the castle retained its use as a\n- \" status symbol, it became apparent that earlier fortifications were unable to stand up to cannons, and so there was no point in trying to make the site genuinel\"\n- |-\n y defensible.[87]\n \n \n \n \n Fortaleza Ozama in the Dominican Republic was the first castle built in the Americas\n \n \n However, some true castles were built in the Americ\n- \"as by the Spanish, English, and French colonies. The first stage of Spanish fort construction has been termed the \\\"castle period\\\", which lasted from 1492 until \"\n- the end of the 16th&#160;century.[88] Starting with Fortaleza Ozama, \"these castles were essentially European medieval castles transposed to America.\"[89] Among\n- \" other defensive structures (including forts and citadels), castles were also built in New France towards the end of the 17th&#160;century.[89] Where artillery \"\n- \"was not as developed as on the battle-fields of Europe, some of Montreal\'s outlying forts were built like the fortified manor houses of France. Fort Longueuil, \"\n- \"built from 1695\\xE2\\x80\\x931698 by a baronial family, has been described as \\\"the most medieval-looking fort built in Canada\\\".[90] The manor house and stables were within\"\n- \" a fortified bailey, with a tall round turret in each corner. The \\\"most substantial castle-like fort\\\" near Montr\\xC3\\xA9al was Fort Senneville, built in 1692 with squ\"\n- are towers connected by thick stone walls, as well as a fortified windmill.[91] Stone forts such as these served as defensive residences, as well as imposing st\n- |-\n ructures to prevent Iroquois incursions.[92]\n Although castle construction faded towards the 16th&#160;century, they did not necessarily all fall out of use. Som\n- e retained some role in local administration and became law courts, while others are still handed down in aristocratic families as hereditary seats. A particula\n- rly famous example of this is Windsor Castle in England which was founded in the 11th&#160;century and is home to the monarch of the United Kingdom.[93] In othe\n- r cases they still had a role in defence. Tower houses, which are closely related to castles and include pele towers, were defended towers that were permanent r\n- esidences built in the 14th to 17th centuries. Especially common in Ireland and Scotland, they could be up to five storeys high and succeeded common enclosure c\n- \"astles and were built by a greater social range of people. While unlikely to provide as much protection as a more complex castle, they offered security against \"\n- |-\n raiders and other small threats.[94][95]\n [edit] Later use and revival castles\n According to archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham, \"the great country\n- \" houses of the seventeenth to twentieth centuries were, in a social sense, the castles of their day\\\".[96] Although there was a trend for the elite to move from \"\n- \"castles into country houses in the 17th&#160;century, castles were not completely useless. In later conflicts, such as the English Civil War (1641\\xE2\\x80\\x931651), many\"\n- \" castles were refortified, although subsequently slighted to prevent them from being used again.[97]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Neuschwanstein is a 19th-century neo-romantic castle bu\"\n- |-\n ilt by Ludwig II of Bavaria.\n \n \n Artificial ruins became popular in the 18th&#160;century as a manifestation of a romantic interest in the Middle Ages and chivalr\n- y, and as part of the broader Gothic Revival in architecture. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar,\n- \" although differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on el\"\n- ements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but they served no military purpose and were solely for display.[98] Revival or mock castles, mos\n- t of which were country houses, were particularly common in the British Isles, for example Belvoir Castle and Eastnor Castle in England and Castell Coch in Wale\n- \"s.[99] Edwin Lutyens\' Castle Drogo (1911\\xE2\\x80\\x931930) was the last flicker of this movement in England.[100] In Mexico, Chapultepec Castle, a former military strongh\"\n- old, used as the imperial residence of the monarchs of the Second Mexican Empire, was created in the Neo-Classical and Neo-Gothic styles.[101] Also, the 19th-ce\n- |-\n ntury Neuschwanstein is one such revival castle in Germany.[102]\n [edit] Construction\n See also: Medieval technology&#160;and Stonemasonry\n \n \n \n \n Construction of a l\n- |-\n arge tower, with scaffolding and masons at work. The holes mark the position of the scaffolding in earlier stages of construction.\n \n \n Once the site of a castle h\n- \"ad been selected&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 whether a strategic position or one intended to dominate the landscape as a mark of power&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the building material had to be sel\"\n- \"ected. An earth and timber castle was cheaper and easier to erect than one built from stone. The costs involved in construction are not well recorded, and most \"\n- surviving records relate to royal castles.[103] A castle with earthen ramparts, a motte, and timber defences and buildings could have been constructed by an uns\n- killed workforce. The source of man-power was probably from the local lordship, and the tenants would already have the necessary skills of felling trees, diggin\n- g, and working timber necessary for an earth and timber castle. Possibly coerced into working for their lord, the construction of an earth and timber castle wou\n- \"ld not have been a drain on a client\\xE2\\x80\\x99s funds. In terms of time, it has been estimated that an average sized motte&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 5&#160;m (16&#160;ft) high and 15&#\"\n- \"160;m (49&#160;ft) wide at the summit&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 would have taken 50&#160;people about 40&#160;working days. An exceptionally expensive motte and bailey was that \"\n- \"of Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 for \\xC2\\xA320. The high cost, relative to other castles of its type, was because labourers had to be imported.[103]\\n\\\n Although thei\"\n- r cost varied according to factors such as their complexity and transport costs for material, it is certain that stone castles cost a great deal more than those\n- \" built from earth and timber. Even a very small tower, such as Peveril Castle, would have cost around \\xC2\\xA3200. In the middle were castles such as Orford, which wa\"\n- \"s built in the late 12th&#160;century for \\xC2\\xA31,400, and at the upper end were those such as Dover, which cost about \\xC2\\xA37,000 between 1112 and 1191.[104] Spending \"\n- \"on the scale of the vast castles such as Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau Gaillard (an estimated \\xC2\\xA315,000 to \\xC2\\xA320,000 between 1196 and 1198) was easily supported by The Crown, but for \"\n- \"lords of smaller areas, castle building was a very serious and costly undertaking. It was usual for a stone castle to take the best part of a decade to finish. \"\n- \"The cost of a large castle built over this time (anywhere from \\xC2\\xA31,000 to \\xC2\\xA310,000) would take the income from several manors, severely impacting on a lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s \"\n- \"finances.[105] Cost in the late 13th&#160;century were of a similar order, with castles such as Beaumaris and Rhuddlan costing \\xC2\\xA314,500 and \\xC2\\xA39,000 respectively\"\n- \". Edward I\\xE2\\x80\\x99s campaign of castle-building in Wales cost \\xC2\\xA380,000 between 1277 and 1304, and \\xC2\\xA395,000 between 1277 and 1329.[106] Renowned designer Master James\"\n- \" of Saint George, responsible for the construction of Beaumaris, explained the cost:\\n\\n\\\n In case you should wonder where so much money could go in a week, we would\"\n- \" have you know that we have needed&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and shall continue to need 400 masons, both cutters and layers, together with 2,000 less skilled workmen, 100&#160;c\"\n- arts, 60&#160;wagons and 30&#160;boats bringing stone and sea coal; 200&#160;quarrymen; 30&#160;smiths; and carpenters for putting in the joists and floor board\n- s and other necessary jobs. All this takes no account of the garrison&#160;... nor of purchases of material. Of which there will have to be a great quantity&#16\n- \"0;... The men\\xE2\\x80\\x99s pay has been and still is very much in arrears, and we are having the greatest difficulty in keeping them because they have simply nothing to \"\n- |-\n live on.[107]\n \n Not only were stone castles expensive to build in the first place, but their maintenance was a constant drain. They contained a lot of timber, wh\n- \"ich was often unseasoned and as a result needed careful upkeep. Castles such as Exeter and Gloucester were often given figures of between \\xC2\\xA320 and \\xC2\\xA350 annually\"\n- \" in the late 12th&#160;century for constant repairs.[108]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The Castle of the Teutonic Order in Malbork, Poland, is an example of brick-built castle and was b\"\n- \"uilt in a style different to that of castles in western Europe and the Near East.[109]\\n\\n\\n\\\n Medieval machines and inventions, such as the treadwheel crane, became \"\n- indispensable during construction, and techniques of building wooden scaffolding were improved upon from Antiquity.[110] Finding stone for shell keeps and castl\n- \"e walls was the first concern of medieval builders, and a major preoccupation was to have quarries close at hand.[111] There are examples of some castles where \"\n- \"stone was quarried on site, such as Chinon, Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Coucy and Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau Gaillard.[111]\\n\\\n Brick-built structures were not necessarily weaker than their stone-bu\"\n- ilt counterparts. In England, brick production proliferated along the south-east coast due to an influx of Flemish weavers and a reduction in the amount of avai\n- lable, leading to a demand for an alternative building material. Brick castles are less common than stone or earth and timber constructions, and often it was ch\n- \"osen for its aesthetic appeal or because it was in fashion, encouraged by the brick architecture of the Low Countries. For example, when Tattershall Castle was \"\n- built between 1430 and 1450, there was plenty of stone available nearby, however the owner, Lord Cromwell, chose to use brick. About 700,000 bricks were used to\n- \" built the castle, which has been described as \\xE2\\x80\\x9Cthe finest piece of medieval brick-work in England\\xE2\\x80\\x9D.[112] Brick castles were predominant in Scandinavia and \"\n- |-\n the Baltic;[113] Denmark had few quarries, and as a result, most of its castles are earth and timber affairs, or later on built from brick.[114]\n [edit] Social c\n- |\n entre\n Main article: Court (royal)\n \n \n \n \n God Speed! by Edmund Blair Leighton, 1900: a late Victorian view of a lady giving a favour to a knight about to do battle\n\n- \"\\n\\n\\\n Due to the lord\'s presence in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as \"\n- \"without the support of his more powerful tennants, a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately \"\n- below them on the social scale, but absentee lords found their power weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit a\n- ll his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.[115] To allow the l\n- ord to concentrate on his duties regarding administration, he had a household of servants to take care of chores such as providing food. The household was run b\n- y a chamberlain, while a treasurer took care of the estate\'s written records. Royal households took essentially the same form as baronial households, although o\n- n a much larger scale and the positions were more prestigious.[116] Without the presence of a lord\'s household, usually because he was staying elsewhere, a cast\n- le would have been a quiet place with few residents, focused on maintaining the castle.[117] Not just a utilitarian structure, as social centres castles were al\n- \"so important places for display. Builders took the opportunity to draw on symbolism to evoke a sense of chivalry that was aspired to in the Middle Ages amongst \"\n- \"the elite. Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features.[118] The \"\n- \"right to crenelate, when granted by a monarch&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 though it was not always necessary&amp;bsp;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was important not just as it allowed a lord to defend his \"\n- \"property but because crenelations and other accoutrements associated with castles were prestigious through their use by the elite.[119]\\n\\\n The purpose of marriage \"\n- \"between the medieval elites was to secure land, not for love; girls were married in their teens, but boys did not marry until they came of age.[120] There is a \"\n- popular conception that women played a peripheral role in the medieval castle household, and that it was dominated by the lord himself. This derives from the im\n- age of the castle as a martial institution, but most castles in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never involved in conflicts or sieges, so the domest\n- \"ic life is a neglected facet.[121] The lady was given a \\\"marriage portion\\\" of her husband\'s estates&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 usually about a third&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 which were hers for \"\n- life, and her husband would inherit on her death; it was her duty to administer them directly, as the lord administered his own land.[122] Despite generally bei\n- ng excluded from military service, a woman could be in charge of a castle, either on behalf of her lordly husband or if she was widowed. Because of their influe\n- nce within the medieval household women influenced construction and design, sometimes through direct patronage; historian Charles Coulson emphasises the role of\n- \" women in applying \\\"a refined aristocratic taste\\\" to castles due to their long term residence.[123] Courtly love was the eroticisation of love between the nobil\"\n- \"ity. Emphasis was placed on restraint between lovers. It was sometimes in private and was expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments. The legend of \"\n- Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages.[124] It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other,\n- \" although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 Henry I of England had over 20&#160;bast\"\n- \"ards for instance&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.[125]\\n\\\n [edit] Castle landscapes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The approach to Kenilworth Castle, Engl\"\n- |-\n and, was lengthened to form a winding route through a moat and an artificial water landscape.\n \n \n As castles were not simply military buildings but centres of adm\n- inistration and symbols of power, they had a significant impact on the landscape around them. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems d\n- \"ue to their role in managing the lord\'s estate,[126] which gave them greater influence over resources.[127] Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer \"\n- parks and were important in their maintenance. Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, and many were found next to castles. Not only were they practical i\n- |-\n n that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.[128]\n Although sometimes the const\n- \"ruction of a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it is more common for the villages nearby to have grown as a result \"\n- of the presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle.[126] The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confi\n- ned to Europe; when Safad Castle was founded in Galilee, in the Holy Land, during the 13th&#160;century, the nearby town benefited from its presence as people c\n- ould now move freely in the area and the 260&#160;villages locally became profitable.[129] When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local l\n- andscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord.[130] Settlements grew naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of p\n- roximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importa\n- \"nce&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement dep\"\n- |-\n opulated.[131]\n During and shortly after the Norman Conquest of England, castles were inserted into important pre-existing towns to control and subdue the popula\n- ce. They were usually location with reference to any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structur\n- es occupying the desired site. In Lincoln, 166&#160;houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a m\n- oat for the castle. As the military importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and the\n- ir financial and judicial roles.[132] When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11th&#160;and 12th&#160;centuries, settlement in those countr\n- |-\n ies was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns is often linked with the creation of a castle.[133]\n Symbolism in relation to castles and their sett\n- ing was very important, as demonstrated by the proximity of high status features such as fish ponds. Also often found near to a castle, sometimes within its def\n- ences, was the parish church.[134] This has been interpreted as a relationship between the church and feudal lords, where the lords patronised the church, which\n- \" was one of the most important institutions of medieval society.[135] Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military can be\"\n- \" highly symbolic. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 comprising a moat and several satellite ponds&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 forced anyone approaching t\"\n- he castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway.[136] Another example is that of the\n- \" 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advance castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and t\"\n- he moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site look more impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer a\n- round the castle, ensuring they got a good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.[137] This also dem\n- onstrates that licenses to crenellate were not solely about a desire to defend oneself, but to have proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who\n- \" was the one responsible for granting permission.[138]\\n\\\n [edit] Warfare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n A trebuchet at Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau des Baux in France\\n\\n\\n\\\n As a static structure, castles could ofte\"\n- n be avoided as their immediate area of influence was about 400&#160;metres (1,300&#160;ft) and their weapons had a short range even early in the age of artille\n- ry. Although leaving an enemy behind the army would allow them to interfere with communications and make raids in the landscape to harry the army. Garrisons wer\n- e expensive, and as a result often small unless the castle was important.[139] Garrisons were smaller in peace time due to the cost of upkeep, and small castles\n- \" were manned by perhaps a couple of watchmen and gate-guards. Even in war garrisons were not necessarily large as too large a defending force would impair the c\"\n- \"astles ability to withstand a long siege; in 1403 a force of 37&#160;archers successfully defended Caernarfon Castle against two assaults by Owain Glynd\\xC5\\xB5r\'s al\"\n- lies during a long siege.[140] Early on, manning a castle was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later re\n- \"placed with paid forces.[140][141] If it was necessary to control the castle for strategic reasons, an army could lay siege to it and starve the defenders out. \"\n- \"Without relief from an outside source, the defending army would eventually submit, but sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies \"\n- of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later.[142] For th\n- e most heavily fortified sites it was more efficient to starve the garrison out that to assault it. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also a\n- \"pplied to the fortified towns of the day.[143] On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally.[144]\\n\\\n If forced to assault \"\n- \"a castle, there were many options available to the attackers. For wooden structures, such as early motte-and-baileys, fire was a real threat and attempts would \"\n- \"be made to set them on fire.[143] Project weapons had been used since antiquity and the mangonel and petraria&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 from Roman and Oriental origins respectiv\"\n- \"ely&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 were the main two that were used into the Middle Ages. The trebuchet, probably evolved from the petraria in the 13th&#160;century, was the most eff\"\n- \"ective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. \"\n- Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high trajectory of its projectile, and would be protected from direct fi\n- re by the curtain walls.[145] Eventually cannons developed to the point where they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the\n- \" main weapon in siege warfare.[83] Walls could be undermined by the creation of a sap; a mine would be dug to conceal the attackers approach to the wall, with w\"\n- ooden supports to prevent the tunnel from collapsing. When the target had been reached, the supports would be burned, caving in the tunnel and bringing down the\n- \" structure above.[146] Battering rams were also used, usually in the form of a tree trunk given an iron cap. They were used to batter down the castle gates, alt\"\n- \"hough they were sometimes used against walls, but with less effect.[147] As an alternative to creating a breach in the walls, an escalade could be attempted to \"\n- capture the walls, with fighting along the walkways on the curtain walls;[148] in this instance, attackers would be very vulnerable to arrowfire, particularly f\n- \"rom crossbows or the English longbow.[149]\\n\\\n [edit] See also\\n\\n\\\n Alc\\xC3\\xA1zar (Spanish castles)\\n\\\n Shiro (Japanese fortifications)\\n\\n\\\n [edit] References\\n\\n\\\n Notes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2\"\n- |\n 005, pp.&#160;7, 10.\n ^ Creighton &amp; Higham 2003, p.&#160;6.\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;32.\n ^ Allen Brown 2004, p.&#160;1.\n ^ a b Coulson 2003, p.&#160;16.\n\n- \"^ Liddiard 2005, pp.&#160;15\\xE2\\x80\\x9317.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;47.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, p.&#160;18.\\n\\\n ^ Stephens 1969, pp.&#160;452\\xE2\\x80\\x93475.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, pp.&#160;2, 6\\xE2\\x80\\x93\"\n- \"7.\\n\\\n ^ Creighton &amp; Higham 2003, pp.&#160;6\\xE2\\x80\\x937.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, p.&#160;2.\\n\\\n ^ a b Friar 2003, p.&#160;214.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;55.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Bar\"\n- \"th\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 397\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;22.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, pp.&#160;214, 216.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;105.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Barth\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 399\\n\\\n ^\"\n- \" Friar 2003, p.&#160;163.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;188.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;190.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Barth\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 402-6.

Typicall\n- |-\n y, costs are borne in the majority by government-funded programs.\n Universal health care systems vary according to the extent of government involvement in provid\n- ing care and/or health insurance. In some countries, such as the UK, Spain, and the Nordic countries, the government has a high degree of involvement in the com\n- missioning or delivery of health care services and access is based on residence rights not on the purchase of insurance. Others have a much more pluralistic del\n- ivery system based on obligatory health with contributory insurance rates related to salaries or income, and usually funded by employers and beneficiaries joint\n- ly. Sometimes the health funds are derived from a mixture of insurance premiums and government taxes. These insurance based systems tend to have a higher propor\n- \"tion of private medical providers obtaining reimbursement, often at heavily regulated rates, through mutual or publicly owned medical insurers. A few countries \"\n- such as the Netherlands and Switzerland operate via privately owned but heavily regulated private insurers. Americans use the term \"single-payer health care\" to\n- \" describe the pooling of health care funds into a single not-for-profit fund for a region or nation. The term is frequently ascribed to the Canadian health care\"\n- \" system.\\n\\\n Universal health care is implemented in all industrialized countries, with the exception of the United States.[1] It is also provided in many developin\"\n- |-\n g countries.\n \n \n \n \n Contents\n \n \n 1 History\n 2 Implementation and Comparisons\n \n 2.1 Americas\n \n 2.1.1 Brazil\n 2.1.2 Canada\n 2.1.3 Colombia\n 2.1.4 Mexico\n 2.1.5 Peru\n 2.1.6 Tri\n- |-\n nidad and Tobago\n 2.1.7 United States\n \n \n 2.2 Asia\n \n 2.2.1 Bhutan\n 2.2.2 People\'s Republic of China\n \n 2.2.2.1 Hong Kong SAR\n \n \n 2.2.3 India\n 2.2.4 Israel\n 2.2.5 Singapore\n- |-\n \n 2.2.6 Taiwan (Republic of China)\n 2.2.7 Thailand\n \n \n 2.3 Europe\n \n 2.3.1 Austria\n 2.3.2 Finland\n 2.3.3 Germany\n 2.3.4 Ireland\n 2.3.5 Netherlands\n 2.3.6 United Kingdom\n \n 2\n- |-\n .3.6.1 England\n 2.3.6.2 Northern Ireland\n 2.3.6.3 Scotland\n 2.3.6.4 Wales\n \n \n \n \n 2.4 Oceania\n \n 2.4.1 Australia\n 2.4.2 New Zealand\n \n \n \n \n 3 Economics\n \n 3.1 Funding models\n \n 3\n- |-\n .1.1 Single-payer\n 3.1.2 Public\n 3.1.3 Compulsory insurance\n 3.1.4 Private insurance\n \n \n \n \n 4 See also\n 5 References\n 6 External links\n \n \n \n \n \n //<![CDATA[\n if (window.showT\n- |-\n ocToggle) { var tocShowText = \"show\"; var tocHideText = \"hide\"; showTocToggle(); } \n //]]>\n \n [edit] History\n Germany has the world\'s oldest universal health care s\n- ystem, with origins dating back to Otto von Bismarck\'s social legislation, which included the Health Insurance Bill of 1883, Accident Insurance Bill of 1884, an\n- d Old Age and Disability Insurance Bill of 1889. In Britain, the National Insurance Act 1911 marked the first steps there towards universal health care, coverin\n- g most employed persons and their financial dependents and all persons who had been continuous contributors to the scheme for at least five years whether they w\n- ere working or not. This system of health insurance continued in force until the creation of the National Health Service in 1948 which extended health care secu\n- rity to all legal residents. Most current universal health care systems were implemented in the period following the Second World War as a process of deliberate\n- \" healthcare reform, intended to make health care available to all, in the spirit of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, signed by e\"\n- |-\n very country doing so. The US did not ratify the social and economic rights sections, including Article 25\'s right to health.[2]\n [edit] Implementation and Compa\n- |-\n risons\n See also: Health care system\n Universal health care is a broad concept that has been implemented in several ways. The common denominator for all such prog\n- rams is some form of government action aimed at extending access to health care as widely as possible and setting minimum standards. Most implement universal he\n- alth care through legislation, regulation and taxation. Legislation and regulation direct what care must be provided, to whom, and on what basis. Usually some c\n- osts are borne by the patient at the time of consumption but the bulk of costs come from a combination of compulsory insurance and tax revenues. Some programs a\n- re paid for entirely out of tax revenues. In others tax revenues are used either to fund insurance for the very poor or for those needing long term chronic care\n- \". The UK government\'s National Audit Office in 2003 published an international comparison of ten different health care systems in ten developed countries, nine \"\n- universal systems against one non-universal system (the U.S.), and their relative costs and key health outcomes.[3] A wider international comparison of 16 count\n- ries, each with universal health care, was published by the World Health Organization in 2004 [4] In some cases, government involvement also includes directly m\n- |-\n anaging the health care system, but many countries use mixed public-private systems to deliver universal health care.\n [edit] Americas\n Argentina, Brazil (see bel\n- ow), Canada (see below), Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico (see below), Panama, Peru (see below), Uruguay, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela all have public unive\n- |-\n rsal health care provided.\n [edit] Brazil\n Main article: Health care in Brazil\n The universal health care system was adopted in Brazil in 1988 after the end of the\n- \" military regime\'s rule.\\n\\\n [edit] Canada\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in Canada\\n\\\n In 1984, the Canada Health Act was passed, which prohibited extra billing by doctors \"\n- on patients while at the same time billing the public insurance system. In 1999, the prime minister and most premiers reaffirmed in the Social Union Framework A\n- \"greement that they are committed to health care that has \\\"comprehensiveness, universality, portability, public administration and accessibility.\\\"[5]\\n\\\n The system \"\n- \"is for the most part publicly funded, yet most of the services are provided by private enterprises or private corporations, although most hospitals are public. \"\n- Most doctors do not receive an annual salary, but receive a fee per visit or service.[6] About 29% of Canadians\' health care is paid for by the private sector o\n- \"r individuals.[7] This mostly goes towards services not covered or only partially covered by Medicare such as prescription drugs, dentistry and vision care.[8] \"\n- \"Many Canadians have private health insurance, often through their employers, that cover these expenses.[9]\\n\\\n The Canada Health Act of 1984 \\\"does not directly bar \"\n- private delivery or private insurance for publicly insured services,\" but provides financial disincentives for doing so. \"Although there are laws prohibiting or\n- \" curtailing private health care in some provinces, they can be changed,\\\" according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.[10][11] The legality of t\"\n- he ban was considered in a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada which ruled in Chaoulli v. Quebec that \"the prohibition on obtaining private health insurance\n- \", while it might be constitutional in circumstances where health care services are reasonable as to both quality and timeliness, is not constitutional where the\"\n- \" public system fails to deliver reasonable services.\\\" The appellant contended that waiting times in Quebec violated a right to life and security in the Quebec C\"\n- harter of Human Rights and Freedoms. The Court agreed, but acknowledged the importance and validity of the Canada Health Act, and at least four of the seven jud\n- \"ges explicitly recognized the right of governments to enact laws and policies which favour the public over the private system and preserve the integrity of the \"\n- |-\n public system.\n [edit] Colombia\n Main article: Health in Colombia\n In 1993 a reform transformed the health care system in Colombia, trying to provide a better, sus\n- |-\n tainable, health care system and to reach every Colombian citizen.\n [edit] Mexico\n Further information: Health care in Mexico\n On December 1, 2006 the Mexican gove\n- \"rnment created the Health Insurance for a New Generation also known as \\\"life insurance for babies\\\".[12][13][14]\\n\\\n On May 28, 2009 Mexico announced Universal Care \"\n- |-\n Coverage for Pregnant Women.[15]\n [edit] Peru\n On April 9, 2009 the Government of Peru published the Law on Health Insurance to enable all Peruvians to access qua\n- lity health services, and contribute to regulate the financing and supervision of these services. The law enables all population to access diverse health servic\n- \"es to prevent illnesses, and promote and rehabilitate people, under a Health Basic Plan (PEAS).[16][17]\\n\\\n [edit] Trinidad and Tobago\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in \"\n- \"Trinidad and Tobago\\n\\\n The universal health care system is used in Trinidad and Tobago and is the primary form of health-care available in the country.

According to the Institute of Medicine of the National A\n- \"cademies of Science, this unfunded \\xE2\\x80\\x9Csafety net\\xE2\\x80\\x9D mandate has contributed to increasing strain on the health system. Emergency treatment is not free or subsid\"\n- ized and some patients cannot or will not pay their bills. Furthermore, this system encourages use of the emergency facilities for primary care and not just for\n- \" emergency purposes.[18]\\n\\\n In lieu of a national program, some states and municipalities have made attempts to approach universality of insurance in their respect\"\n- ive jurisdictions. The state of Massachusetts implemented a near-universal health care system by mandating that residents purchase health insurance by July 1, 2\n- 007.[19] The City of San Francisco is also undertaking a universal health care system for uninsured residents.[20][21] Hawaii has, since 1974, required employer\n- s to provide employees working more than 20 hours per week with a comprehensive health insurance plan.[22] California, Maine and Vermont are also considering or\n- \" seeking to implement universal or near-universal systems.[23] In July, 2009, Connecticut passed into law a plan called SustiNet, with the goal of achieving nea\"\n- |-\n r-universal healthcare coverage by 2014.[24]\n Whether a federal system of universal health care should be implemented in the US remains a hotly debated political\n- \" topic, with Americans divided in their views.\\n\\\n [edit] Asia\\n\\\n Bhutan, Brunei, China,[25] Hong Kong SAR, India[citation needed], Kuwait[citation needed], Qatar[cita\"\n- tion needed], UAE[citation needed], Saudi Arabia[citation needed], Israel,[26] Japan, Malaysia[citation needed], South Korea, Seychelles[citation needed], Sri L\n- |-\n anka,[27] Taiwan,[28], Pakistan[citation needed] and Thailand[citation needed] have universal health care.\n [edit] Bhutan\n Main article: Health in Bhutan\n The Roya\n- \"l Government of Bhutan maintains a policy of free and universal access to primary health care. As hospital facilities in the country are limited, patients with \"\n- diseases that cannot be treated in Bhutan, such as cancer, are normally referred to hospitals in India for treatment. Such referral treatment is also carried ou\n- \"t at the cost of the Royal Government.[29]\\n\\\n [edit] People\'s Republic of China\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare system reform in the People\'s Republic of China\\n\\\n Since the \"\n- \"founding of the People\'s Republic of China, the goal of health care programs has been to provide care to every member of the population and to make maximum use \"\n- |-\n of limited health-care personnel, equipment, and financial resources.[citation needed]\n China is undertaking a reform on its health care system, which was largel\n- y privatized in the 1990s. The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS), is a new 2005 initiative to overhaul the healthcare system, particularly int\n- ended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, the annual cost of medical cover is 50 yuan (US$7) per person. Of that, 20 yuan is paid i\n- \"n by the central government, 20 yuan by the provincial government and a contribution of 10 yuan is made by the patient. As of September 2007, around 80% of the \"\n- whole rural population of China had signed up (about 685 million people). The system is tiered, depending on the location. If patients go to a small hospital or\n- \" clinic in their local town, the scheme will cover from 70-80% of their bill. If they go to a county one, the percentage of the cost being covered falls to abou\"\n- \"t 60%. And if they need specialist help in a large modern city hospital, they have to bear most of the cost themselves, the scheme would cover about 30% of the \"\n- \"bill.[30]\\n\\\n On January 21, 2009, the Chinese government announced that a total of 850 billion yuan will be provided between 2009 and 2011 in order to improve the \"\n- \"existing health care system.[31]\\n\\\n [edit] Hong Kong SAR\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in Hong Kong\\n\\\n Hong Kong is one of the healthiest places in the world.[32] Because \"\n- of its early health education, professional health services, and well-developed health care and medication system, Hongkongers enjoy a life expectancy of 84 for\n- \" females and 78 for males,[33] which is the second highest in the world, and 2.94 infant mortality rate, the fourth lowest in the world.[34][35]\\n\\\n There are two m\"\n- \"edical schools in Hong Kong, and several schools offering courses in traditional Chinese medicine. The Hospital Authority is a statutory body that operates and \"\n- \"manages all public hospitals. Hong Kong has high standards of medical practice. It has contributed to the development of liver transplantation, being the first \"\n- |-\n in the world to carry out adult to adult live donor liver transplant in 1993.[36]\n [edit] India\n Main article: Healthcare in India\n India has a universal health ca\n- re system run by the local (state or territorial), governments. The government hospitals, some of which are among the best hospitals in India,[37] provide treat\n- |-\n ment at taxpayer expense. Most essential drugs are offered free of charge in these hospitals.\n Government hospitals provide treatment either free or at minimal c\n- harges. For example, an outpatient card at AIIMS (one of the best hospitals in India) costs a one time fee of rupees 10 (Around 20 cents US) and thereafter outp\n- atient medical advice is free. In-hospital treatment costs depend on financial condition of the patient and facilities utilized by him but are usually much less\n- \" than the private sector. For instance, a patient is waived treatment costs if he is below poverty line. Another patient may seek for an air-conditioned room if\"\n- \" he is willing to pay extra for it. The charges for basic in-hospital treatment and investigations are much less compared to the private sector. The cost for th\"\n- |-\n ese subsidies comes from annual allocations from the central and state governments.\n Primary health care is provided by city and district hospitals and rural pri\n- mary health centres (PHCs). These hospitals provide treatment free of cost. Primary care is focused on immunization, prevention of malnutrition, pregnancy, chil\n- d birth, postnatal care, and treatment of common illnesses.[citation needed] Patients who receive specialized care or have complicated illnesses are referred to\n- \" secondary (often located in district and taluk headquarters) and tertiary care hospitals (located in district and state headquarters or those that are teaching\"\n- \" hospitals).[citation needed] However, the fact that the government sector is understaffed and underfinanced and poor services at state run hospitals forces man\"\n- |-\n y people to visit private medical practitioners.\n Now organizations like Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotional Trust and other private organizations have s\n- |-\n tarted creating hospitals and clinics in India, which also provide free or subsidized health care and subsidized insurance plans.[citation needed]\n [edit] Israel\n- |-\n \n Main article: Health care in Israel\n \n \n \n \n \n This section does not cite any references or sources.

(October 2009)\\n\\n\\n\\\n In Israel, the National Health Insurance Law (or National Health Insurance Act) is \"\n- the legal framework which enables and facilitates basic, compulsory universal health care. The Law was put into effect by the Knesset on January 1, 1995, and wa\n- s based on recommendations put forward by a National Committee of Inquiry which examined restructuring the health care system in Israel in the late 1980s. Prior\n- \" to the law\'s passage approximately 85% of the population was already covered by voluntarily belonging to one of four nation-wide, not-for-profit health mainten\"\n- ance organizations (HMOs/sick funds). However, there were three problems associated with this arrangement. First, membership in the largest HMO, Clalit, require\n- \"d one to belong to the Histadrut labor organization, even if a person did not wish to (or could not) have such an affiliation while other HMOs restricted entry \"\n- to new members based on age, pre-existing conditions or other factors. Second, different HMOs provided different levels of benefit coverage or services to their\n- \" members and lastly was the issue mentioned above whereby a certain percentage of the population, albeit a small one, did not have health insurance coverage at \"\n- |-\n all.\n \n \n \n \n \n This section may stray from the topic of the article&#160;into the topic of another article, Health care in Israel. Please help improve this section o\n- |-\n r discuss this issue on the talk page.\n \n \n Before the law went into effect, all the HMOs collected premiums directly from members. However, upon passage of the la\n- w, a new progressive national health insurance tax was levied through Israel\'s social security agency which then re-distributes the proceeds to the HMOs based o\n- n their membership and its demographic makeup. This ensured that all citizens would now have health coverage. While membership in one of the HMOs now became com\n- pulsory for all, free choice was introduced into movement of members between HMOs (a change is allowed once per year), effectively making the various HMOs compe\n- te equally for members among the populace. Annually, a committee appointed by the ministry of health publishes a \"basket\" or uniform package of medical services\n- \" and prescription formulary which all HMOs must provide as a minimum service to all their members. Achieving this level of equality ensured that all citizens ar\"\n- e guaranteed to receive basic healthcare regardless of their HMO affiliation which was one of the principal aims of the law. An appeals process was put in place\n- \" to handle rejection of treatments and procedures by the HMOs and evaluating cases falling outside the \\\"basket\\\" of services or prescription formulary.\\n\\\n While the\"\n- \" law is generally considered a success and Israeli citizens enjoy a high standard of medical care comparatively, with more competition having been introduced in\"\n- \"to the field of health care in the country, and order having been brought into what was once a somewhat disorganized system, the law nevertheless does have its \"\n- critics. First and foremost among the criticisms raised is that the \"basket\" may not provide enough coverage. To partly address this issue, the HMOs and insuran\n- \"ce companies (often in conjunction with employers) began offering additional \\\"supplementary\\\" insurance to cover certain additional services not included in the \"\n- \"basket. However, since this insurance is optional, critics argue that it goes against the spirit of the new law which stressed equality among all citizens with \"\n- respect to healthcare. Another criticism is that in order to provide universal coverage to all, the tax income base amount (the maximum amount of yearly earning\n- s that are subject to the tax) was set rather high, causing many high-income taxpayers to see the amount they pay for their health premiums (now health tax) sky\n- |-\n rocket. Finally, some complain about the constantly rising costs of copayments for certain services.\n [edit] Singapore\n Main article: Health care in Singapore\n Sin\n- gapore has a universal health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through compulsory savings and price controls, while the private secto\n- r provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources.[38] Singapore currently has the\n- \" lowest infant mortality rate in the world (equaled only by Iceland) and among the highest life expectancies from birth, according to the World Health Organizat\"\n- ion.[39] Singapore has \"one of the most successful healthcare systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in communi\n- ty health outcomes,\" according to an analysis by global consulting firm Watson Wyatt.[40] Singapore\'s system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payro\n- \"ll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as \\\"actively regulating the supply \"\n- and prices of healthcare services in the country\" to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a \"very difficult system to r\n- eplicate in many other countries.\" Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by t\n- \"he government\'s programs.[40]\\n\\\n [edit] Taiwan (Republic of China)\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in Taiwan\\n\\\n The current health care system in Taiwan, known as National \"\n- Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars\n- . The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.[41] NHI is mainly financed t\n- hrough premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-fo\n- |-\n r-service predominated for both public and private providers.\n NHI delivers universal coverage offered by a government-run insurer. The working population pays p\n- \"remiums split with their employers, others pay a flat rate with government help and the poor or veterans are fully subsidized. Taiwan\\xE2\\x80\\x99s citizens no longer hav\"\n- |-\n e to worry about going bankrupt due to medical bills.[42]\n Under this model, citizens have free range to choose hospitals and physicians without using a gatekeep\n- \"er and do not have to worry about waiting lists. NHI offers a comprehensive benefit package that covers preventive medical services, prescription drugs, dental \"\n- \"services, Chinese medicine, home nurse visits and many more. Working people do not have to worry about losing their jobs or changing jobs because they will not \"\n- lose their insurance. Since NHI, the previously uninsured have increased their usage of medical services. Most preventive services are free such as annual check\n- \"ups and maternal and child care. Regular office visits have co-payments as low as US $5 per visit. Co-payments are fixed and unvaried by the person\\xE2\\x80\\x99s income.[\"\n- |-\n 43]\n [edit] Thailand\n Main article: Health care in Thailand\n Thailand introduced universal coverage reforms in 2001, becoming one of only a handful of lower-middle\n- \" income countries to do so. Means-tested health care for low income households was replaced by a new and more comprehensive insurance scheme, originally known a\"\n- s the 30 baht project, in line with the small co-payment charged for treatment. People joining the scheme receive a gold card which allows them to access servic\n- es in their health district, and, if necessary, be referred for specialist treatment elsewhere. The bulk of finance comes from public revenues, with funding all\n- ocated to Contracting Units for Primary Care annually on a population basis. According to the WHO, 65% of Thailand\'s health care expenditure in 2004 came from t\n- he government, 35% was from private sources.[38] Although the reforms have received a good deal of critical comment, they have proved popular with poorer Thais,\n- \" especially in rural areas, and survived the change of government after the 2006 military coup. The then Public Health Minister, Mongkol Na Songkhla, abolished \"\n- \"the 30 baht co-payment and made the UC scheme free. It is not yet clear whether the scheme will be modified further under the coalition government that came to \"\n- |-\n power in January 2008.[44][45][46]\n [edit] Europe\n Virtually all of Europe has publicly sponsored and regulated universal health care. The public plans in some co\n- \"untries provide basic or \\\"sick\\\" coverage only; their citizens can purchase supplemental insurance for additional coverage. Countries with universal health care \"\n- include Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, I\n- celand, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal,[47] Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, S\n- |-\n lovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine[48] and the United Kingdom.[49]\n [edit] Austria\n In Austria, public health care (the care, not the running of hospita\n- ls itself) is funded by means of so called \"Social insurance contributions\" accounting for approx. 24% of the salary, they are therefore no taxes as such. 7% of\n- \" the contribution is reserved for health coverage in one of Austria\'s 22 public insurances, but cannot exceed EUR 281,- monthly (USD 399,-). Depending on the jo\"\n- b, somebody will be insured at one of the 9 state-run territorial health funds or at job specific insurances, e.g. public employees or farmers have their own (c\n- ompulsory) health insurance. 22 public insurances for 8 million people is subject to violent criticism, as tremendous savings could be reached by unifying the i\n- nsurances to one centralized provider. However, no Austrian state is willing to give up its own public insurances as it is sphere of action for electoral campai\n- gns. The operation of hospitals is not paid by social contributions, but by taxes. This means that general health coverage adds up to much more and is therefore\n- \" more expensive as often depicted. Austria spends approx. 10% of its GDP for health coverage.\\n\\\n [edit] Finland\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in Finland\\n\\\n In Finland, pub\"\n- lic medical services at clinics and hospitals are run by the municipalities (local government) and are funded 76% by taxation, 20% by patients through access ch\n- arges, and 4% by others. Private provision is mainly in the primary care sector. There are a few private hospitals [50]. The main hospitals are either municipal\n- \"ly owned (funded from local taxes) or run by the medical teaching universities (funded jointly by the municipalities and the national government). According to \"\n- \"a survey published by the European Commission in 2000, Finland\'s is in the top 4 of EU countries in terms of satisfaction with their hospital care system: 88% o\"\n- f Finnish respondents were satisfied compared with the EU average of 41.3%.[51] Finnish health care expenditures are below the European average.[citation needed\n- \"] The private medical sector accounts for about 14 percent of total health care spending. Only 8% of doctors choose to work in private practice, and some of the\"\n- |-\n se also choose to do some work in the public sector.[citation needed]\n Taxation funding is partly local and partly nationally based. The national social insuranc\n- e institution KELA reimburses part of patients prescription costs and makes a contribution towards private medical costs (including dentistry) if they choose to\n- \" be treated in the private sector rather than the public sector. Patient access charges are subject to annual caps. For example GP visits cost \\xE2\\x82\\xAC11 per visit w\"\n- \"ith annual \\xE2\\x82\\xAC33 cap; hospital outpatient treatment \\xE2\\x82\\xAC22 per visit; a hospital stay, including food, medical care and medicines \\xE2\\x82\\xAC26 per 24 hours, or \\xE2\\x82\\xAC12 if\"\n- \" in a psychiatric hospital. After a patient has spent \\xE2\\x82\\xAC590 per year on public medical services (including prescription drugs), all treatment and medications t\"\n- |-\n hereafter in that year are free.\n [edit] Germany\n Main article: Health care in Germany\n Germany has the world\'s oldest universal health care system, with origins d\n- \"ating back to Otto von Bismarck\'s Health Insurance Act of 1883.[52] As mandatory health insurance, it originally applied only to low-income workers and certain \"\n- government employees, but has gradually expanded to cover the great majority of the population.[53] The system is decentralized with private practice physicians\n- \" providing ambulatory care, and independent, mostly non-profit hospitals providing the majority of inpatient care. Approximately 92% of the population is covere\"\n- d by a \'Statutory Health Insurance\' plan, which provides a standardized level of coverage through any one of approximately 1100 public or private sickness funds\n- . Standard insurance is funded by a combination of employee contributions, employer contributions and government subsidies on a scale determined by income level\n- . Higher income workers sometimes choose to pay a tax and opt out of the standard plan, in favor of \'private\' insurance. The latter\'s premiums are not linked to\n- \" income level but instead to health status.[54]\\n\\\n Historically, the level of provider reimbursement for specific services is determined through negotiations betwe\"\n- \"en regional physician\'s associations and sickness funds. Since 1976 the government has convened an annual commission, comprised of representatives of business, \"\n- labor, physicians, hospitals, and insurance and pharmaceutical industries.[55] The commission takes into account government policies and makes recommendations t\n- \"o regional associations with respect to overall expenditure targets. In 1986 expenditure caps were implemented and were tied to the age of the local population \"\n- as well as the overall wage increases. Although reimbursement of providers is on a fee-for-service basis the amount to be reimbursed for each service is determi\n- ned retrospectively to ensure that spending targets are not exceeded. Capitated care, such as that provided by U.S. health maintenance organizations, has been c\n- onsidered as a cost containment mechanism but would require consent of regional medical associations, and has not materialized.[56] Copayments were introduced i\n- n the 1980s in an attempt to prevent overutilization and control costs. The average length of hospital stay in Germany has decreased in recent years from 14 day\n- s to 9 days, still considerably longer than average stays in the U.S. (5 to 6 days).[57][58] The difference is partly driven by the fact that hospital reimburse\n- ment is chiefly a function of the number of hospital days as opposed to procedures or the patient\'s diagnosis. Drug costs have increased substantially, rising n\n- \"early 60% from 1991 through 2005. Despite attempts to contain costs, overall health care expenditures rose to 10.7% of GDP in 2005, comparable to other western \"\n- |-\n European nations, but substantially less than that spent in the U.S. (nearly 16% of GDP).[59]\n [edit] Ireland\n Main article: Health care in Ireland\n The public hea\n- \"lth care system of the Republic of Ireland is governed by the Health Act 2004, which established a new body to be responsible for providing health and personal \"\n- social services to everyone living in Ireland - the Health Service Executive. The new national health service came into being officially on 1 January 2005; howe\n- ver the new structures are currently in the process of being established as the reform programme continues. In addition to the public-sector, there is also a la\n- |-\n rge private healthcare market.\n [edit] Netherlands\n Main article: Health care in the Netherlands\n The Netherlands has a dual-level system. All primary and curative\n- \" care (i.e. the family doctor service and hospitals and clinics) is financed from private compulsory insurance. Long term care for the elderly, the dying, the l\"\n- ong term mentally ill etc. is covered by social insurance funded from taxation. According to the WHO, the health care system in the Netherlands was 62% governme\n- |-\n nt funded and 38% privately funded as of 2004.[38]\n Insurance companies must offer a core universal insurance package for the universal primary, curative care wh\n- ich includes the cost of all prescription medicines. They must do this at a fixed price for all. The same premium is paid whether young or old, healthy or sick.\n- \" It is illegal in The Netherlands for insurers to refuse an application for health insurance, to impose special conditions (e.g. exclusions, deductibles, co-pay\"\n- \"s etc or refuse to fund treatments which a doctor has determined to be medically necessary). The system is 50% financed from payroll taxes paid by employers to \"\n- \"a fund controlled by the Health regulator. The government contributes an additional 5% to the regulator\'s fund. The remaining 45% is collected as premiums paid \"\n- by the insured directly to the insurance company. Some employers negotiate bulk deals with health insurers and some even pay the employees\' premiums as an emplo\n- yment benefit). All insurance companies receive additional funding from the regulator\'s fund. The regulator has sight of the claims made by policyholders and th\n- \"erefore can redistribute the funds its holds on the basis of relative claims made by policy holders. Thus insurers with high payouts will receive more from the \"\n- regulator than those with low payouts. Thus insurance companies have no incentive to deter high cost individuals from taking insurance and are compensated if th\n- ey have to pay out more than might be expected. Insurance companies compete with each other on price for the 45% direct premium part of the funding and try to n\n- \"egotiate deals with hospitals to keep costs low and quality high. The competition regulator is charged with checking for abuse of dominant market positions and \"\n- the creation of cartels that act against the consumer interests. An insurance regulator ensures that all basic policies have identical coverage rules so that no\n- \" person is medically disadvantaged by his or her choice of insurer.\\n\\\n Hospitals in the Netherlands are also regulated and inspected but are mostly privately run a\"\n- nd for profit, as are many of the insurance companies. Patients can choose where they want to be treated and have access to information on the internet about th\n- e performance and waiting times at each hospital. Patients dissatisfied with their insurer and choice of hospital can cancel at any time but must make a new agr\n- |-\n eement with another insurer.\n Insurance companies can offer additional services at extra cost over and above the universal system laid down by the regulator, e.g\n- \". for dental care. The standard monthly premium for health care paid by individual adults is about \\xE2\\x82\\xAC100 per month. Persons on low incomes can get assistance f\"\n- rom the government if they cannot afford these payments. Children under 18 are insured by the system at no additional cost to them or their families because the\n- \" insurance company receives the cost of this from the regulator\'s fund.\\n\\\n [edit] United Kingdom\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in the United Kingdom\\n\\\n Each of the Countri\"\n- \"es of the United Kingdom has a National Health Service that provides public healthcare to all UK permanent residents that is free at the point of need and paid \"\n- for from general taxation. However, since Health is a devolved matter, considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries.[60]\n- |-\n \n [edit] England\n Main article: Healthcare in England\n The National Health Service (NHS), created by the National Health Service Act 1946 has provided the majority\n- \" of healthcare in England since its launch on 5 July 1948.\\n\\\n The NHS Constitution for England documents at high level, the objectives of the NHS, the legal rights\"\n- \" and responsibilities of the various parties (patients, staff, NHS trust boards) and the guiding principles which govern the service.[61] The NHS constitution m\"\n- \"akes it clear that it provides a comprehensive service, available to all irrespective of age, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, religion or belief; \"\n- \"that access to NHS services is based on clinical need and not an individual\\xE2\\x80\\x99s ability to pay; and that care is never refused on unreasonable grounds. Patient \"\n- choice in terms of doctor, care, treatments and place of treatment is an important aspect of the NHS\'s ambition, and in some cases patients can elect for treatm\n- ent in other European countries at the NHS\'s expense. Wait times are low, with most people able to see their primary care doctor on the same day or the followin\n- g day[62] and only 36.1% of hospital admissions are from a waiting list, with the remainder being either emergencies admitted immediately or else pre-booked adm\n- issions or similar (e.g. child birth) [63]. No patient should experience a delay of more than 18 weeks from initial hospital referral to final treatment[64]. Th\n- |-\n is includes the time for all investigative tests and consultations, and two thirds of patients are currently treated in under 12 weeks.[65]\n Although centrally f\n- \"unded there is no large central bureaucracy to manage it. Responsibility is highly devolved to geographical areas through Strategic Health Authorities and even \"\n- more locally through NHS primary care trusts , NHS hospital trusts and increasingly to NHS foundation trusts which are providing even more decentralized service\n- s within the NHS framework, with more decision making taken by local people, patients and staff. The central government office, the Department of Health, is not\n- \" involved in day to day decision making in either the Strategic Health Authorities or the individual local trusts (primarily health, hospital or ambulance) or t\"\n- he national specialist trusts such as NHS Blood and Transplant, but it does lay down general guidelines for them to follow. Local trusts are accountable to thei\n- |-\n r local populations, whilst government ministers are accountable to Parliament for the service overall.\n The NHS provides, among other things, primary care, in-p\n- \"atient care, long-term healthcare, psychiatric care and treatments ophthalmology and dentistry. All treatment is free with the exception of certain charges for \"\n- prescriptions, dentistry and ophthalmology (which themselves are free to children, the elderly, the unemployed and those on low incomes). Eighty-nine percent of\n- \" NHS prescriptions are obtained free of charge, mosly children, pensioners and pregnat women. Others pay a flat rate of \\xC2\\xA37.20[66], and others may cap their ann\"\n- ual charges. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance. Private insurance accounts for only 4 percent of heal\n- th expenditure and covers little more than a tenth of the population. [67]. Private insurers in the UK only cover acute care from specialists. They do not cover\n- \" generalist consultations, pre-existing conditions, medical emergencies, organ transplants, chronic conditions such as diabetes or conditions such as pregnancy \"\n- or HIV. [68] Most NHS general practitioners are private doctors who contract to provide NHS services but most hospitals are publicly owned and run through NHS T\n- rusts. A few NHS medical services such as \"surgicentres\") are sub-contracted to private providers [69] as are some non-medical services (such as catering). Some\n- \" capital projects such as new hospitals have been funded through the Private Finance Initiative, enabling investment without excessive strain on the public sect\"\n- |-\n or borrowing requirement.\n [edit] Northern Ireland\n Main article: Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland\n Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland is the des\n- |-\n ignation of the national public health service in Northern Ireland.\n [edit] Scotland\n Main article: Healthcare in Scotland\n NHS Scotland, created by the National H\n- ealth Service (Scotland) Act 1947, was also launched on 5 July 1948 though it has always been a separate organisation.

The Australian Senate rejected the changes multiple times and they were passed only after a joint s\n- itting after the 1974 double dissolution election. However, Medibank was supported by the subsequent Fraser Coalition (Australia) government and became a key fe\n- \"ature of Australia\\xE2\\x80\\x99s public policy landscape. The exact structure of Medibank/Medicare, in terms of the size of the rebate to doctors and hospitals and the wa\"\n- y it has administered, has varied over the years. The original Medibank program proposed a 1.35% levy (with low income exemptions) but these bills were rejected\n- \" by the Senate, and so Medibank was funded from general taxation. In 1976, the Fraser Government introduced a 2.5% levy and split Medibank in two: a universal s\"\n- |-\n cheme called Medibank Public and a government-owned private health insurance company, Medibank Private.\n During the 1980s, Medibank Public was renamed Medicare b\n- y the Hawke Labor government, which also changed the funding model, to an income tax surcharge, known as the Medicare Levy, which was set at 1.5%, with exemptio\n- ns for low income earners.[71] The Howard Coalition government introduced an additional levy of 1.0%, known as the Medicare Levy Surcharge, for those on high an\n- nual incomes ($70,000) and do not have adequate levels of private hospital coverage.[72] This was part of an effort by the Coalition to encourage take-up of pri\n- vate health insurance. According to WHO, government funding covered 67.5% of Australia\'s health care expenditures in 2004; private sources covered the remaining\n- \" 32.5% of expenditures.[38]\\n\\\n [edit] New Zealand\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in New Zealand\\n\\\n As with Australia, New Zealand\'s healthcare system is funded through gen\"\n- eral taxation. According to the WHO, government sources covered 77.4% of New Zealand\'s health care costs in 2004; private expenditures covered the remaining 22.\n- |-\n 6%.[38]\n [edit] Economics\n Main article: Health care economics\n [edit] Funding models\n Universal health care in most countries has been achieved by a mixed model of\n- \" funding. General taxation revenue is the primary source of funding, but in many countries it is supplemented by specific levies (which may be charged to the in\"\n- dividual and/or an employer) or with the option of private payments (either direct or via optional insurance) for services beyond that covered by the public sys\n- |-\n tem.\n Almost all European systems are financed through a mix of public and private contributions.[73] The majority of universal health care systems are funded pr\n- imarily by tax revenue (e.g. Portugal[73] and Spain). Some nations, such as Germany, France[49] and Japan[74] employ a multi-payer system in which health care i\n- s funded by private and public contributions. However, much of the non-government funding is by defined contributions by employers and employees to regulated no\n- |-\n n-profit sickness funds. These contributions are compulsory and vary according to a person\'s salary, and are effectively a form of hypothecated taxation.\n A dist\n- inction is also made between municipal and national healthcare funding. For example, one model is that the bulk of the healthcare is funded by the municipality,\n- \" speciality healthcare is provided and possibly funded by a larger entity, such as a municipal co-operation board or the state, and the medications are paid by \"\n- |-\n a state agency.\n Universal health care systems are modestly redistributive. Progressivity of health care financing has limited implications for overall income in\n- |-\n equality.[75]\n [edit] Single-payer\n Main article: Single-payer health care\n The term single-payer health care is used in the United States to describe a funding me\n- chanism meeting the costs of medical care from a single fund. Although the fund holder is usually the government, some forms of single-payer employ a public-pri\n- |-\n vate system.\n [edit] Public\n Some countries (notably the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain) have eliminated insurance entirely and choose to fund health care direct\n- ly from taxation. Other countries with insurance-based systems effectively meet the cost of insuring those unable to insure themselves via social security arran\n- |\n gements funded from taxation, either by directly paying their medical bills or by paying for insurance premiums for those affected.\n [edit] Compulsory insurance\n\n- This is usually enforced via legislation requiring residents to purchase insurance, though sometimes, in effect, the government provides the insurance. Sometime\n- s there may be a choice of multiple public and private funds providing a standard service (e.g. as in Germany) or sometimes just a single public fund (as in Can\n- |-\n ada).\n In some European countries where there is private insurance and universal health care, such as Germany, Belgium, and The Netherlands, the problem of adver\n- se selection (see Private insurance below) is overcome using a risk compensation pool to equalize, as far as possible, the risks between funds. Thus a fund with\n- \" a predominantly healthy, younger population has to pay into a compensation pool and a fund with an older and predominantly less healthy population would receiv\"\n- e funds from the pool. In this way, sickness funds compete on price and there is no advantage to eliminate people with higher risks because they are compensated\n- \" for by means of risk-adjusted capitation payments. Funds are not allowed to pick and choose their policyholders or deny coverage, but then mainly compete on pr\"\n- |-\n ice and service. In some countries the basic coverage level is set by the government and cannot be modified.[76]\n Ireland at one time had a \"community rating\" sy\n- \"stem through VHI, effectively a single-payer or common risk pool. The government later opened VHI to competition but without a compensation pool. This resulted \"\n- in foreign insurance companies entering the Irish market and offering cheap health insurance to relatively healthy segments of the market which then made higher\n- \" profits at VHI\'s expense. The government later re-introduced community rating through a pooling arrangement and at least one main major insurance company, BUPA\"\n- \", then withdrew from the Irish market.\\n\\\n [edit] Private insurance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n This article may be inaccurate in or unbalanced towards certain viewpoints.

(June 2009)\n \n \n In some countries with universal coverage, priva\n- te insurance often excludes many health conditions which are expensive and which the state health care system can provide. For example in the UK, one of the lar\n- |-\n gest private health care providers is BUPA which has the following list of general exclusions[77].\n Dental/oral treatment (such as fillings, gum disease, jaw shr\n- \"inkage, etc)\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; pregnancy and childbirth\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; temporary relief of symptoms\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; convalescence, rehabilitation and general nursing care\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; drugs and dressings fo\"\n- \"r out-patient or take-home use\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; screening and preventive treatment; birth control, conception, sexual problems and sex changes\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; allergies or allergic diso\"\n- \"rders; chronic conditions\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; eyesight\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; physical aids and devices\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; *deafness; cosmetic, reconstructive or weight loss treatment\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; ageing, menopaus\"\n- \"e and puberty&#160;; dialysis\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; complications from excluded or restricted conditions/ treatment&#160;; HRT and bone densitometry\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; learning difficulti\"\n- \"es, behavioural and developmental problems&#160;; overseas treatment and repatriation&#160;; AIDS/HIV\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; pre-existing or special conditions&#160;; experi\"\n- \"mental drugs and treatment\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; sleep problems and disorders&#160;; speech disorders\\xE2\\x80\\xA0\\n\\\n all of which (except overseas repatriation) are available for free \"\n- \"or very low cost from the NHS. (\\xE2\\x80\\xA0 indicates that treatment may be provided in certain circumstances)\\n\\\n Where voluntary insurance (often private) is predominant,\"\n- \" such as in the U.S., medical (health) insurance is subject to the well-known economic problem of adverse selection which may also be referred to as a market fa\"\n- ilure.[citation needed] Adverse selection in insurance markets occurs because those providing insurance have limited information with which to estimate the heal\n- th risks on which they may need to pay future claims.[citation needed] In simple terms, those with poor health are more likely to apply for insurance and more l\n- ikely to need treatments requiring high insurance company payouts.[citation needed] Those with good health may find the cost of insurance too high for the perce\n- ived benefit, and some will remove themselves from the risk pool.[citation needed] This adverse selection concentrates the risk pool, thereby further raising co\n- sts.[citation needed] In practical terms, the potential for adverse selection means that private insurers have an economic incentive to use medical underwriting\n- \" to \'weed out\' high cost applicants in order to avoid adverse selection.[citation needed] Among the potential solutions posited by economists are single payer s\"\n- ystems as well as other methods of ensuring that health insurance is universal, such as by requiring all citizens to purchase insurance and limiting the ability\n- \" of insurance companies to deny insurance to individuals or vary price between individuals.[78][79]\\n\\n\\\n [edit] See also\\n\\n\\\n Health care compared - tabular comparisons\"\n- \" of the US, Canada, and other countries not shown above.\\n\\\n Health care reform debate in the United States\\n\\\n Health insurance cooperative\\n\\\n Millennium Development Goal\"\n- |-\n s\n National health insurance\n Publicly-funded health care\n Single-payer health care\n \n [edit] References\n \n \n ^ a b Insuring America\'s Health: Principles and Recommenda\n- |-\n tions, Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science, 2004-01-14\n ^ \"Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Questions and Answers\" (PDF).

The term has a history of scholarly debate surrounding its precise meaning, but a castle is usually considered to be the \"private fortif\n- ied residence\" of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a fortress, which was not a home, or a fortified town, which was a public defence. Over the extended pe\n- riod of time that castles were built they took on a great many forms with many different features, but some, such as the curtain wall and arrow slits, were comm\n- |-\n onplace.\n Castles originated in the 9th&#160;and 10th&#160;centuries, when the fall of the Carolingian Empire in Europe and the rise of feudal society led to the\n- \" territory of the collapsing empire being divided between individual lords and princes, and an emphasis on personal defence. Castles controlled their immediate \"\n- areas, and were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as protection from an enemy. Although t\n- \"heir military origins are often emphasised, castles also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local \"\n- |-\n populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near elements such as a mill, integral to life in the community.\n Many castles were o\n- riginally built from earth and timber, and had their defences replaced later by stone equivalents. In the late 12th&#160;and early 13th&#160;century, a scientif\n- ic approach to castle defence emerged. Towers proliferated, with an emphasis on flanking fire, and many new castles were polygonal, while previously they had re\n- \"lied more on the lay of the land and were curvilinear, or relied on concentric defence&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 several stages of defence within each other that could all funct\"\n- ion at the same time, thereby maximising the castle\'s firepower. The origin of these changes in defence has been attributed to a mixture of influence from the C\n- \"rusades&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 where castle technology was advanced such as the new type of concentric fortification&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and drawing on earlier defences such as Roman fo\"\n- rts for inspiration. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, and devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defen\n- |-\n ce into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress, and to dominate their landscape.\n Gunpowder, introduced to Europe i\n- n the 14th&#160;century, did not have an immediate impact on castle building. Castles do not show adaptation to resist bombardment by cannons until the 15th&#16\n- \"0;century, when artillery became powerful enough to break down walls. Although castles were built across Europe well into the 16th&#160;century, new techniques \"\n- to deal with improved cannon eventually led to them becoming uncomfortable and undesirable places to live, and so true castles went into decline, replaced by ar\n- tillery forts with no role in administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18th&#160;century onwards, there was a renewed interest in cas\n- |-\n tles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no defensive purpose.\n \n \n \n \n Contents\n \n \n 1 Definition\n \n 1\n- |-\n .1 Etymology\n 1.2 Defining characteristics\n \n \n 2 Common features\n \n 2.1 Motte\n 2.2 Bailey and enceinte\n 2.3 Keep\n 2.4 Curtain wall\n 2.5 Moat\n 2.6 Gatehouse\n 2.7 Other feat\n- |+\n ures\n \n \n 3 History\n \n 3.1 Antecedents\n 3.2 Origins and early castles\n 3.3 Innovation and scientific design\n 3.4 Advent of gunpowder\n 3.5 Later use and revival castles\n \n- |-\n \n 4 Construction\n 5 Social centre\n 6 Castle landscapes\n 7 Warfare\n 8 See also\n 9 References\n 10 Further reading\n 11 External links\n \n \n \n \n \n //<![CDATA[\n if (window.showTocTo\n- |-\n ggle) { var tocShowText = \"show\"; var tocHideText = \"hide\"; showTocToggle(); } \n //]]>\n \n [edit] Definition\n [edit] Etymology\n \n \n \n \n The Norman \"White Tower\", the keep\n- \" of the Tower of London, exemplifies all uses of a castle: city defence, a residence, and a place of refuge in times of crisis.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Castle is derived from the Lat\"\n- \"in word castellum. This is a diminutive of the word castrum, which means \\\"fortified place\\\". The Old English castel, French ch\\xC3\\xA2teau, Spanish castillo, Italian c\"\n- \"astello, as well as other European words for castle derive from castellum.[2] The word castle was introduced into English shortly before the Norman Conquest to \"\n- denote this type of building, then new to England, introduced to the country by Normans working for Edward the Confessor.[3] Although the various terms used for\n- \" castles in Europe derive from the same root, they are not universally applied to the same types of structures. The French ch\\xC3\\xA2teau is used to describe a grand \"\n- \"country house at the heart of an estate, regardless of the presence of fortifications.[4]\\n\\\n [edit] Defining characteristics\\n\\\n In its simplest terms, the definition \"\n- of a castle accepted amongst academics is \"a private fortified residence\".[5] This contrasts with earlier fortifications, such as Anglo Saxon burhs and walled c\n- \"ities such as Constantinople and Antioch in the Middle East: castles were not communal defences but were built and owned by the local feudal lord, either for th\"\n- emselves of for their monarch.[6] In the late 20th&#160;century, there was a trend to refine the definition of a castle by including the criterion of feudal own\n- ership, thus tying castles to the medieval period. However this does not necessarily reflect what medieval people called castles. During the First Crusade (1096\n- \"\\xE2\\x80\\x931099) the Frankish armies encountered walled settlements and forts that they indiscriminately called castles, but would not be considered such under the mode\"\n- |-\n rn definition.[5]\n \n \n \n \n Windsor Castle in England was first built as a fortification of the Norman Conquest, and today is home to Queen Elizabeth II of the United\n- \" Kingdom.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Castles served a range of purposes, the most important of which were military, administrative, and domestic. Early castles were primarily military i\"\n- \"nstitutions, places of protection from an enemy. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which could be used as a base of operations \"\n- in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England as both defensive and offensive tools to pacify the inhabitants.[7] As William the Co\n- nqueror advanced through England after the Norman Conquest in 1066, he fortifed key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087 he establis\n- hed 36&#160;castles such as Warwick Castle, which was used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.[8][9] However, a recent trend to view castles les\n- s as military institutions and more as social structures has questioned the current definition. During the Middle Ages, castles tended to lose their military si\n- |-\n gnificance and became more important as residences and statements of power.[10]\n In Britain the term \"castle\" has also been erroneously used to refer to Iron Age\n- \" fortifications such as Maiden Castle, Dorset.[11] A castle was not only a bastion and prison but also a place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers.\"\n- \" Over time the aesthetics of the design became more important, as the castle\'s appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant. Cast\"\n- les were built as defensive measures and offensive weapons, but comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls. Although castles still prov\n- |-\n ided protection from low levels of violence in later periods, eventually they were succeeded by country houses as high status residences.[12]\n [edit] Common feat\n- \"ures\\n\\\n [edit] Motte\\n\\\n Main article: Motte-and-bailey\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The wooden palisades surmounting mottes were often later replaced in stone, as in this example at Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau \"\n- |-\n de Gisors in France.\n \n \n A motte was a mound with a flat top. The mounds were often artificial, although sometimes they incorporated a pre-existing feature of the\n- \" landscape. The excavation of earth for the mound would leave a ditch around the motte, which acted as a further defence. Sometimes a nearby stream would be div\"\n- erted to flood the ditch, creating a moat. Motte and moat derive from the same Old French word, indicating that they were originally associated features and dep\n- \"ended on each other for their construction. Although the motte is usually associated with the bailey to form a motte-and-bailey castle, this was not always the \"\n- \"case and there are instances where a motte existed on its own. \\\"Motte\\\" refers to the mound alone, but it was often surmounted by a fortified structure, such as \"\n- a keep, and the flat top would be surrounded by a palisade.[13] The motte was accessed by a flying bridge as represented by the Bayeux Tapestry\'s depiction of C\n- \"h\\xC3\\xA2teau de Dinan.[14] Sometimes a motte covered an older castle or hall, whose rooms now became underground storage areas and prisons beneath a new donjon.[15]\\n\"\n- |-\n [edit] Bailey and enceinte\n Main article: Enceinte\n A bailey, also called a ward, was a fortified enclosure. They were a common feature of castles, and most had a\n- t least one. The keep on top of the motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home of t\n- \"he rest of the lord\'s household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities could all be expected to be \"\n- \"found in the bailey. There was a progression for lords to build more comfortable accommodation for themselves within the bailey, which resulted in the creation \"\n- of another bailey that separated the high status buildings such as the lord\'s chambers and the chapel, from the everyday structures such as the workshops and ba\n- rracks.[16] Although often associated with the motte-and-bailey type of castle, baileys could be found as independent defensive structures. These simple fortifi\n- cations were called ringworks.[17] The terms bailey and enceinte are linked, as the enceinte was the castle\'s main defensive enclosure. A castle could have seve\n- ral baileys but only one enceinte. Castles with no keep and which relied on their outer defences for protection are sometimes called enceinte castles;[18] these\n- \" were the earliest form of castles, before the donjon arrived in the 10th century.[19]\\n\\\n [edit] Keep\\n\\\n Main article: Keep\\n\\\n A keep was a great tower and usually the s\"\n- \"trongest point of a castle before the introduction of concentric defence. Keep was not a term used in the medieval period&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the term was applied from the\"\n- \" 16th&#160;century onwards&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and donjon was used to refer to great towers,[20] or turris in Latin. Dungeon is a corrupted form of donjon and means a dark\"\n- \", unwelcoming prison.[21] Although often the strongest part of a castle and a last place of refuge if the outer defences fell, the keep was not left empty in ca\"\n- se of attack but was used as a residence by the lord who owned the castle, or his guests or representatives.[22] Initially this was only the usual pattern in En\n- gland, when after the Norman Conquest of 1066 the \"conquerors lived for a long time in a constant state of alert\"; elsewhere the lord\'s wife presided over a sep\n- \"arate residence (domus, aula or mansio in Latin) close to the keep, and the donjon was a barracks and headquarters. Gradually the two functions merged into the \"\n- same building; for many examples choosing the appropriate term can be difficult, and the highest residential storeys have large windows.[23] In motte-and-bailey\n- \" castles, the keep was on top of the motte.[13]\\n\\\n [edit] Curtain wall\\n\\\n Main article: Curtain wall (fortification)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Carcassonne, France, showing the classic feat\"\n- |-\n ures of the curtain walls, defensive ditch with arched bridge, and cylindrical flanking towers, with a gatehouse and additional wooden defensive structures.\n \n \n C\n- \"urtain walls were defensive walls enclosing a bailey. They had to be high enough to make scaling the walls with ladders difficult and thick enough to withstand \"\n- bombardment from siege engines which from the 15th&#160;century onwards included artillery. A typical wall could be 3&#160;m (9.8&#160;ft) wide and 12&#160;m (3\n- \"9&#160;ft) tall, although sizes varied greatly between castles. To protect them from undermining, curtain walls were sometimes given a stone skirt around their \"\n- base. Walkways along the tops of the curtain walls allowed defenders to rain missiles on enemies from above, and battlements gave them further protection. Curta\n- in walls would be studded with towers to allow enfilading fire along the wall.[24] Arrow slits in the walls did not become common in Europe until the 13th&#160;\n- |-\n century, for fear that they might compromise the wall\'s strength.[25]\n [edit] Moat\n Main article: Moat\n A moat was a defensive ditch with steep sides, and could be\n- \" either water-filled or dry. Its purpose was to stop engines such as siege towers from reaching the curtain wall and to prevent the walls from being undermined.\"\n- \" Water moats are found in low lying areas. Moats were often crossed by a drawbridge, although these were often replaced by stone bridges. The moat around Flint \"\n- \"Castle in Wales needed 1,800&#160;excavators to build. Fortified islands could be added to the moat, adding another layer of defence. Water defences, including \"\n- moats as well as natural lakes, had the benefit of dictating the enemy\'s approach to the castle.[26] The 13th-century Caerphilly Castle, also in Wales, has some\n- \" of the largest water defences in Western Europe, on a site covering over 30&#160;acres (120,000&#160;m2), created by flooding the valley to the south of the ca\"\n- |-\n stle.[27]\n [edit] Gatehouse\n Main article: Gatehouse\n An undeveloped entrance is the weakest part in a circuit of defences. To overcome this, the gatehouse was dev\n- eloped, allowing those inside the castle to control the flow of traffic. In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in\n- \" stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot, so to allow the defenders to see the gate without exposing themselves projecting towers were added on each si\"\n- de of the gate, in a style similar to that developed by the Romans.[28] Contained within the building would be a series of defences to make a direct assault mor\n- \"e difficult than battering down a simple gate. There would be one or more portcullis&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 a wooden grille reinforced with metal to block a passage&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 \"\n- and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry an enemy. The passage through the gatehouse would have been lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant ha\n- \"d to spend being shot at in a confined space.[29] It is a popular myth that so-called murder-holes&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 openings in the roof of the gateway passge&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 \"\n- were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead, and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was completel\n- y impractical. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, similar to machicolations or to pour water to extinguish fires.[30] Provision was made i\n- n the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation, so the gate was never left undefended, although this evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of\n- \" defence.[31] The entrance to a castle could be further elaborated through the addition of a barbican. This consisted of a rampart and ditch in front of the gat\"\n- ehouse.[32] Developed in the 13th and 14th centuries,[33] it could also include a tower. The purpose of a barbican was not just to provide another line of defen\n- |-\n ce but to dictate the only approach to the gate.[34]\n [edit] Other features\n Battlements were most often found surmounting curtain walls, although also on the top\n- s of gatehouses, and comprised several elements; crenellations, hoardings and machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating\n- \" crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks on top of a wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at or\"\n- \" drop objects on attackers at the base of the wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Ma\"\n- chicolations were stone openings in the top of the wall that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base off the wall in a similar fashion to hoarding\n- s.[35] Arrowslits, also commonly called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts to be fired on attack\n- ers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but the size of the opening could also impede the defender if it w\n- \"as too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming.[36]\\n\\\n [edit] History\\n\\\n [edit] Antecedents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Ambleside Roman \"\n- |-\n fort, England\n \n \n Historian Charles Coulson states that the accumulation of wealth and resources such as food in ancient societies led to the need for defensive s\n- \"tructures. The earliest fortifications originate from the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. \"\n- \"Northern Europe was slower than the east to develop defensive structures and it was not until the Bronze Age that hill forts were developed, which proliferated \"\n- across Europe in the Iron Age. They differed to their eastern counterparts through the use of earthworks rather than stone as a building material.[37] Many eart\n- hworks survive today, along with evidence of palisades to accompany the ditches. In Europe, oppida emerged in the 2nd&#160;century BC; they were densely inhabit\n- ed fortified settlements, such as the oppidum of Manching, and developed from hill forts.[38] The Romans encountered fortified settlements such as hill forts an\n- \"d oppida when expanding their territory into northern Europe.[38] Although primitive, they were often effective, and required extensive siege engines and other \"\n- siege warfare techniques to overcome, such as at the Battle of Alesia. The Romans\' own fortifications (castra) varied from simple temporary earthworks thrown up\n- \" by armies on the move, to elaborate permanent stone constructions, notably the milecastles of Hadrian\'s Wall. Roman forts were generally rectangular with round\"\n- \"ed corners \\xE2\\x80\\x93 a \\\"playing-card shape\\\".[39]\\n\\\n [edit] Origins and early castles\\n\\\n Like the feudal society they were part of, castles had their origins in the 9th&#160\"\n- ;and 10th&#160;centuries. This period saw the emergence of a social and military elite in the Carolingian Empire and the development of mounted fighting. Fighti\n- ng on horseback was a costly and time consuming endeavour, requiring specialised equipment and trained horses, and for their efforts these early knights were gr\n- anted land by the lords for whom they fought. The link between knight and lord was the basis of feudalism, and could go higher up the social scale with loyaltie\n- s between lords, dukes, princes, and kings. When the Carolingian Empire collapsed in the 9th&#160;and 10th&#160;centuries, it took with it effective centralised\n- \" administration,[40] and it fell to the landed elite to take over control. This led to the privatisation of government, with local lords taking on the responsib\"\n- ility for the local economy and justice. Although castles were private buildings, lordship was a public office and the holder had a responsibility to protect hi\n- s peasants.[41] There is a traditional view that feudalism was a tool of social disintegration that contributed to the downfall of the Carolingian Empire, howev\n- er modern academic opinion is that it was a successor to previous government rather than a rival.[42] Castles sometimes required the permission of the king or o\n- ther high authority. Charles the Bald prohibited the construction of castles without his permission and ordered them destroyed; this could be the earliest refer\n- ence to castles being built without permission, breaking the feudal agreement between lord and vassal, however there are very few castles dated with certainty f\n- \"rom the mid-9th&#160;century. Converted into a donjon in around 950, Dou\\xC3\\xA9-la-Fontaine, in France, is the oldest standing castle in Europe.[43]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n One of the e\"\n- \"arliest representations of a castle from the Bayeux Tapestry. It depicts attackers of Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Dinan in France using fire, one of the threats to wooden castl\"\n- \"es.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Military historian Allen Brown asserts that in the absence of a working state and the breakdown of society associated with the decline of the Carolingian \"\n- \"Empire, feudal ties became more important. The rise of castles is not solely attributed to defence of the new feudal lords\\xE2\\x80\\x99 lands, but as a reaction to attack\"\n- s by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings.[40] It is likely that the castle evolved from the practice of fortifying a lordly home. In a time of social unrest, a lord w\n- \"ould wish to protect his home or hall, and the greatest threat was that of fire as they were usually wooden. To protect against this, and keep other threats at \"\n- \"bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an \"\n- artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers.[44] While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is an\n- cient, raising a motte to exploit the advantages of height is a medieval innovation.[45] A bank and ditch enclosure was a simple form of defence, and when found\n- \" without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enh\"\n- anced by the addition a stone curtain wall.[46] Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door.\n- \" This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 to make it harder to throw objects in&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and to change the entrance from ground floor to\"\n- \" first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls and contained the lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s household.[4\"\n- \"7] Castles were not just used as defensive sites, but to enhance a lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area,[4\"\n- |-\n 8] and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.[49]\n References to castles in texts such as charters from 1000 onwards i\n- ncreased greatly. Historians have interpreted this as evidence of a sudden increase in the number of castles in Europe around this time; their interpretation ha\n- s been supported by archaeologists dating the construction of castle sites through the examination of ceramics.[50] The increase in Italy began in the 950s, wit\n- h numbers of castles increasing by a factor of three to five every 50&#160;years, whereas other parts of Europe such as France and Spain were slower. In 950, Pr\n- ovence was home to 12&#160;castles, by 1000 this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100.[51] Despite the common period in which castles rose to pro\n- \"minence in Europe, their form and design varied from region to region. In the early 11th&#160;century, the motte&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 an artificial mound surmounted by a pa\"\n- \"lisade and tower&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was the most common form of castle in Europe, aside from Scandinavia.[51] Castles were introduced into England shortly before the Norm\"\n- \"an Conquest in 1066.[52] The motte and bailey&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 a motte with an outer enclosure&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 remained the dominant form of castle in England, Wales, and Irel\"\n- |-\n and well into the 12th&#160;century.[53] At the same time, castle architecture in mainland Europe became more sophisticated.[54]\n \n \n \n \n Built in 1138, Castle Risin\n- \"g in England is an example of an elaborate donjon.[55]\\n\\n\\n\\\n The donjon&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 or great tower[56]&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was at the centre of this change in castle architecture\"\n- \" in the 12th&#160;century. Central towers proliferated, and typically had a square plan, with walls 3 to 4&#160;m (9.8 to 13&#160;ft) thick. Their decoration em\"\n- ulated Romanesque architecture, and sometimes incorporated double windows similar to those found in church bell towers. Donjons, which were the residence of the\n- \" lord of the castle, evolved to become more spacious. The changes in design changed from utilitarian to decorative to impose upon the landscape as a symbol of l\"\n- ordly power, sometimes compromising defence for the sake of display.[54] Historians have interpreted the widespread presence of castles across Europe in the 11t\n- |-\n h&#160;and 12th&#160;centuries as evidence that warfare was common, and usually between local lords.[57]\n In some countries, it was necessary to obtain the permi\n- ssion of the king through a licence to crenellate, or else the builder risked it being slighted. This was not universal, as in some countries, the monarch had l\n- \"ittle control over lords, or required the construction of new castles to aid in securing the land&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 as was the case in England after 1066 and the Holy La\"\n- \"nd during the Crusades&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 so was unconcerned about granting permission. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built cast\"\n- les, and as a result there are 4,000 in the country. Before the 12th&#160;century, castles were as uncommon in Denmark as they had been in England before the No\n- |-\n rman Conquest. The introduction of castles to Denmark was a reaction to attacks from Wendish pirates, and they were usually intended as coastal defences.[58]\n [e\n- \"dit] Innovation and scientific design\\n\\\n Until the 12th century, stone-built and earth and timber castles were contemporary,[59] but by the late 12th&#160;century \"\n- the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly attributed to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of t\n- imber and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone.[60] Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork\n- \" castles were by no means useless.[61] This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; at the s\"\n- \"tart of the 15th&#160;century Owain Glynd\\xC5\\xB5r\\xE2\\x80\\x99s castle at Sycharth, founded in the late 11th&#160;century, was a timber structure.[62][63]\\n\\\n In the late 12th&#16\"\n- 0;century, there was an obvious change in castle architecture. Until then, castles probably had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrows\n- lits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the lay of the land, and the resu\n- lt was often irregular or curvilinear. The design of castles was of course not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the m\n- id-12th&#160;century.[64] By the end of the 12th&#160;century or the early 13th&#160;century, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in sh\n- ape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level t\n- o allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall. These later castles would not always have a keep, but this may have been because the more compl\n- \"ex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers provided space for habitation to make up for the \"\n- loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to t\n- \"he castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 although there was great variety in the styles of g\"\n- \"ateway and entrances&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and one or more portcullis.[65]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The gatehouse to the inner ward of Beeston Castle, England, was built in the 1220s and has an \"\n- |-\n entrance between two half-round towers.[66]\n \n \n When seeking to explain this change in the complexity and style of castles, antiquarians found their answer in the\n- \" Crusades. It seemed logical that the Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architectu\"\n- \"re. There were legends such as that of Lalys&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 an architect from Palestine who reputedly went to Wales after the Crusades and greatly enhanced the castle\"\n- \"s in the south of the country&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and it was assumed that great architects such as James of Saint George originated in the East. However, in the mid-20th&#\"\n- 160;century this view was cast into doubt. Legends were discredited, and in the case of James of Saint George, it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d\'E\n- \"sp\\xC3\\xA9ranche, in France. If the innovations in fortification had derived from the East, it would have been expected for their influence to be seen from 1100 onwar\"\n- \"ds, immediately after the Christians were victorious in the First Crusade (1096\\xE2\\x80\\x931099), rather than nearly 100&#160;years later.[67] Roman remains in western E\"\n- urope were still upstanding in many places, and as they too featured flanking round-towers, and entrances between two flanking towers. The castle builders of we\n- stern Europe were aware of and influenced by Roman design as demonstrated by the reuse of Saxon shore forts in England, a late Roman innovation despite their na\n- \"me, and in Spain the wall around the city of Avila imitated Roman architecture when it was built in 1091.[67] It has been argued&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 by historian Smail in \"\n- \"Crusading warfare&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 that the case for the influence of eastern fortification on the west has been overstated, and that crusaders of the 12th&#160;century\"\n- \" in fact learnt very little about scientific design from Byzantine and Saracen defences.[68] The explanation for this is that a well sited castle that made use \"\n- of natural defences and had strong ditches and walls had no need for a scientific design. An example of this approach is Karak Castle. Although there were no sc\n- \"ientific elements to its design it was almost impregnable, and in 1187 Saladin chose to lay siege to the castle and starve out its garrison rather than risk an \"\n- |-\n assault.[68]\n After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did not return to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the principality of Antioch, the\n- \" County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their acquisitions were designed mostly by Syrian mas\"\n- \"ter-masons. Their design was very similar to a Roman fort or Byzantine tetrapyrgia: a square curtain wall with towers in each corner, also usually square and no\"\n- t projecting much beyond the curtain wall. In the interior, the keep would have had a square plan and generally be undecorated.[69] While castles were used to h\n- \"old a site and control movement of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified.[70] Castle architecture in the East became more \"\n- \"complex around the late 12th and early 13th&#160;century after the stalemate of the Third Crusade (1189\\xE2\\x80\\x931192). Both Christians and Muslims created fortificati\"\n- ons, and the character of each was different. Saphadin, the 13th-century ruler of the Saracens, created structures with large rectangular towers that influenced\n- \" Muslim architecture and were copied again and again, however they had little influence on Crusader castles.[71]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Krak des Chevaliers is a concentric castle \"\n- \"built with both rectangular and rounded towers. It is amongst the best preserved Crusader castles.[72]\\n\\n\\n\\\n In the early 13th&#160;century, Crusaders castles were \"\n- mostly built by Military Orders, such as the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Knights of the Teutonic Order. They were responsible for the foundation o\n- f sites such as Krak des Chevaliers, Margat, and Belvoir. The forms of the castle varied not just between orders, but individually from castle to castle, althou\n- gh it was common for the castles founded in this period to have concentric defences.[73] The concept, which originated in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, w\n- as to remove the reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be more than one ring of defensive wall, one i\n- nside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If an assailant made it past the first line o\n- \"f defences into the outer enclosure, they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall to secure \"\n- \"the fall of the castle.[74] Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe, for instance when Edward I of England&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 who had himself been on Crusade&\"\n- \"#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 built castles in Wales in the late 13th&#160;century, four of the eight he founded were concentric.[73][74] Not all the features of the Crusader castle\"\n- s from the 13th &amp;nbspcentury were emulated in Europe; for instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the entrance in the side of a tower and for th\n- ere to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this feature to be found in Europe.\n- |-\n [73]\n It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels; something that contemporary builders in Europe were wary o\n- f, believing that they weakened the wall\'s structural integrity. Arrowslits did not compromise the wall\'s strength, but it was not until Edward I\'s programme of\n- \" castle building that they were adopted in Europe.[25] The Crusades also led to the introduction of machicolations into western architecture. Until the 13th&#16\"\n- 0;century, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed\n- \" the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the \"\n- |-\n East long before the arrival of the Crusades, and perhaps as early as the first half of the 8th&#160;century in Syria.[75]\n Although France has been described as\n- \" \\\"the heartland of medieval architecture\\\", the English were at the forefront of castle architecture in the 12th&#160;century. French historian Francois Gebelin \"\n- said:[76] \"The great revival in military architecture was led, as one would naturally expect, by the powerful kings and princes of the time; by the sons of Will\n- iam the Conqueror and their descendants, the Plantagenets, when they became dukes of Normandy. These were the men who built all the most typical twelfth-century\n- \" fortified castles remaining to-day\\\".[77] Despite this, by the beginning of the 15th&#160;century, the rate of castle construction in England and Wales went int\"\n- o decline; the new castles were generally of a lighter build than earlier structures and presented few innovations, although strong sites were still created suc\n- h as that of Raglan in Wales. At the same time, French castle architecture came to the fore and led the way in the field of medieval fortifications. Across Euro\n- \"pe&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 particularly the Baltic, Germany, and Scotland&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 castles were built well into the 16th&#160;century.[78]\\n\\\n [edit] Advent of gunpowder\\n\\\n Artillery\"\n- \" powered by gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns are not recorded until the 1380s and were unpredictable and inaccurate \"\n- \"weapons.[79] Castles were adapted to allow small guns&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 averaging between 19.6 and 22&#160;kg (43 and 49&#160;lb)&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 to fire from towers. These gun\"\n- s were too heavy for a man to carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle on the edge of the gun port he could fire the weapon. The g\n- \"un ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the \"\n- \"timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there \"\n- is an intact example at in Doornenburg Castle in Denmark. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on t\n- |-\n op to allow the gunner to aim.[80]\n \n \n \n \n The rounded walls of Sarzana Castle in Italy are adaptated to gunpowder.\n \n \n This form is very common in castles adapted fo\n- \"r guns, found in Egypt, Italy, Scotland, and Spain, and elsewhere in between. Other types of port, though less common were horizontal slits&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 allowing on\"\n- \"ly lateral movement&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and large square openings, which allowed greater movement.[80] The use of guns for defence gave rise to artillery castles, such as \"\n- \"that of Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Ham in France, Defences against guns was not developed until a later stage.[81] Ham is an example of the trend for new castles to dispense w\"\n- \"ith earlier features such as machicolations, tall towers, and crenellations.[82]\\n\\\n Bigger guns were developed, and in the 15th&#160;century became an alternative \"\n- \"to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages before the advent\"\n- \" of gunpowder&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 were those of a greater range and greater power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made bigger and bigger. By the 1450s\"\n- \" guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mohammed II at the Siege of Constantinople.[83] The response towards more eff\"\n- ective cannons was to build thicker walls than in previous castles and to prefer round towers as the curving sides were more likely to deflect a shot than a fla\n- \"t surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures had to find a way to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled \"\n- behind a castle\'s curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.[84] Often, castles constructed before the age of gunpowder would be incapable of using gun\n- s as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface fo\n- r the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which\n- \" avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle\'s defences. These could be built from earthier earth or stone and were used to mount w\"\n- |-\n eapons.[85]\n Around 1500, the innovation of the angled bastion over curved was developed in Italy.[86] The elite who were responsible for castle construction wer\n- e forced to choose between the new type which could withstand cannon-fire but as a result was ugly and uncomfortable to live in, or to stick with an earlier mor\n- e elaborate style with had more aesthetic appeal and was more of a status symbol. The second choice was more popular, and while the castle retained its use as a\n- \" status symbol, it became apparent that earlier fortifications were unable to stand up to cannons, and so there was no point in trying to make the site genuinel\"\n- |-\n y defensible.[87]\n \n \n \n \n Fortaleza Ozama in the Dominican Republic was the first castle built in the Americas\n \n \n However, some true castles were built in the Americ\n- \"as by the Spanish, English, and French colonies. The first stage of Spanish fort construction has been termed the \\\"castle period\\\", which lasted from 1492 until \"\n- the end of the 16th&#160;century.[88] Starting with Fortaleza Ozama, \"these castles were essentially European medieval castles transposed to America.\"[89] Among\n- \" other defensive structures (including forts and citadels), castles were also built in New France towards the end of the 17th&#160;century.[89] Where artillery \"\n- \"was not as developed as on the battle-fields of Europe, some of Montreal\'s outlying forts were built like the fortified manor houses of France. Fort Longueuil, \"\n- \"built from 1695\\xE2\\x80\\x931698 by a baronial family, has been described as \\\"the most medieval-looking fort built in Canada\\\".[90] The manor house and stables were within\"\n- \" a fortified bailey, with a tall round turret in each corner. The \\\"most substantial castle-like fort\\\" near Montr\\xC3\\xA9al was Fort Senneville, built in 1692 with squ\"\n- are towers connected by thick stone walls, as well as a fortified windmill.[91] Stone forts such as these served as defensive residences, as well as imposing st\n- |-\n ructures to prevent Iroquois incursions.[92]\n Although castle construction faded towards the 16th&#160;century, they did not necessarily all fall out of use. Som\n- e retained some role in local administration and became law courts, while others are still handed down in aristocratic families as hereditary seats. A particula\n- rly famous example of this is Windsor Castle in England which was founded in the 11th&#160;century and is home to the monarch of the United Kingdom.[93] In othe\n- r cases they still had a role in defence. Tower houses, which are closely related to castles and include pele towers, were defended towers that were permanent r\n- esidences built in the 14th to 17th centuries. Especially common in Ireland and Scotland, they could be up to five storeys high and succeeded common enclosure c\n- \"astles and were built by a greater social range of people. While unlikely to provide as much protection as a more complex castle, they offered security against \"\n- |-\n raiders and other small threats.[94][95]\n [edit] Later use and revival castles\n According to archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham, \"the great country\n- \" houses of the seventeenth to twentieth centuries were, in a social sense, the castles of their day\\\".[96] Although there was a trend for the elite to move from \"\n- \"castles into country houses in the 17th&#160;century, castles were not completely useless. In later conflicts, such as the English Civil War (1641\\xE2\\x80\\x931651), many\"\n- \" castles were refortified, although subsequently slighted to prevent them from being used again.[97]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Neuschwanstein is a 19th-century neo-romantic castle bu\"\n- |-\n ilt by Ludwig II of Bavaria.\n \n \n Artificial ruins became popular in the 18th&#160;century as a manifestation of a romantic interest in the Middle Ages and chivalr\n- y, and as part of the broader Gothic Revival in architecture. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar,\n- \" although differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on el\"\n- ements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but they served no military purpose and were solely for display.[98] Revival or mock castles, mos\n- t of which were country houses, were particularly common in the British Isles, for example Belvoir Castle and Eastnor Castle in England and Castell Coch in Wale\n- \"s.[99] Edwin Lutyens\' Castle Drogo (1911\\xE2\\x80\\x931930) was the last flicker of this movement in England.[100] In Mexico, Chapultepec Castle, a former military strongh\"\n- old, used as the imperial residence of the monarchs of the Second Mexican Empire, was created in the Neo-Classical and Neo-Gothic styles.[101] Also, the 19th-ce\n- |-\n ntury Neuschwanstein is one such revival castle in Germany.[102]\n [edit] Construction\n See also: Medieval technology&#160;and Stonemasonry\n \n \n \n \n Construction of a l\n- |-\n arge tower, with scaffolding and masons at work. The holes mark the position of the scaffolding in earlier stages of construction.\n \n \n Once the site of a castle h\n- \"ad been selected&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 whether a strategic position or one intended to dominate the landscape as a mark of power&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the building material had to be sel\"\n- \"ected. An earth and timber castle was cheaper and easier to erect than one built from stone. The costs involved in construction are not well recorded, and most \"\n- surviving records relate to royal castles.[103] A castle with earthen ramparts, a motte, and timber defences and buildings could have been constructed by an uns\n- killed workforce. The source of man-power was probably from the local lordship, and the tenants would already have the necessary skills of felling trees, diggin\n- g, and working timber necessary for an earth and timber castle. Possibly coerced into working for their lord, the construction of an earth and timber castle wou\n- \"ld not have been a drain on a client\\xE2\\x80\\x99s funds. In terms of time, it has been estimated that an average sized motte&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 5&#160;m (16&#160;ft) high and 15&#\"\n- \"160;m (49&#160;ft) wide at the summit&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 would have taken 50&#160;people about 40&#160;working days. An exceptionally expensive motte and bailey was that \"\n- \"of Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 for \\xC2\\xA320. The high cost, relative to other castles of its type, was because labourers had to be imported.[103]\\n\\\n Although thei\"\n- r cost varied according to factors such as their complexity and transport costs for material, it is certain that stone castles cost a great deal more than those\n- \" built from earth and timber. Even a very small tower, such as Peveril Castle, would have cost around \\xC2\\xA3200. In the middle were castles such as Orford, which wa\"\n- \"s built in the late 12th&#160;century for \\xC2\\xA31,400, and at the upper end were those such as Dover, which cost about \\xC2\\xA37,000 between 1112 and 1191.[104] Spending \"\n- \"on the scale of the vast castles such as Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau Gaillard (an estimated \\xC2\\xA315,000 to \\xC2\\xA320,000 between 1196 and 1198) was easily supported by The Crown, but for \"\n- \"lords of smaller areas, castle building was a very serious and costly undertaking. It was usual for a stone castle to take the best part of a decade to finish. \"\n- \"The cost of a large castle built over this time (anywhere from \\xC2\\xA31,000 to \\xC2\\xA310,000) would take the income from several manors, severely impacting on a lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s \"\n- \"finances.[105] Cost in the late 13th&#160;century were of a similar order, with castles such as Beaumaris and Rhuddlan costing \\xC2\\xA314,500 and \\xC2\\xA39,000 respectively\"\n- \". Edward I\\xE2\\x80\\x99s campaign of castle-building in Wales cost \\xC2\\xA380,000 between 1277 and 1304, and \\xC2\\xA395,000 between 1277 and 1329.[106] Renowned designer Master James\"\n- \" of Saint George, responsible for the construction of Beaumaris, explained the cost:\\n\\n\\\n In case you should wonder where so much money could go in a week, we would\"\n- \" have you know that we have needed&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and shall continue to need 400 masons, both cutters and layers, together with 2,000 less skilled workmen, 100&#160;c\"\n- arts, 60&#160;wagons and 30&#160;boats bringing stone and sea coal; 200&#160;quarrymen; 30&#160;smiths; and carpenters for putting in the joists and floor board\n- s and other necessary jobs. All this takes no account of the garrison&#160;... nor of purchases of material. Of which there will have to be a great quantity&#16\n- \"0;... The men\\xE2\\x80\\x99s pay has been and still is very much in arrears, and we are having the greatest difficulty in keeping them because they have simply nothing to \"\n- |-\n live on.[107]\n \n Not only were stone castles expensive to build in the first place, but their maintenance was a constant drain. They contained a lot of timber, wh\n- \"ich was often unseasoned and as a result needed careful upkeep. Castles such as Exeter and Gloucester were often given figures of between \\xC2\\xA320 and \\xC2\\xA350 annually\"\n- \" in the late 12th&#160;century for constant repairs.[108]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The Castle of the Teutonic Order in Malbork, Poland, is an example of brick-built castle and was b\"\n- \"uilt in a style different to that of castles in western Europe and the Near East.[109]\\n\\n\\n\\\n Medieval machines and inventions, such as the treadwheel crane, became \"\n- indispensable during construction, and techniques of building wooden scaffolding were improved upon from Antiquity.[110] Finding stone for shell keeps and castl\n- \"e walls was the first concern of medieval builders, and a major preoccupation was to have quarries close at hand.[111] There are examples of some castles where \"\n- \"stone was quarried on site, such as Chinon, Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Coucy and Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau Gaillard.[111]\\n\\\n Brick-built structures were not necessarily weaker than their stone-bu\"\n- ilt counterparts. In England, brick production proliferated along the south-east coast due to an influx of Flemish weavers and a reduction in the amount of avai\n- lable, leading to a demand for an alternative building material. Brick castles are less common than stone or earth and timber constructions, and often it was ch\n- \"osen for its aesthetic appeal or because it was in fashion, encouraged by the brick architecture of the Low Countries. For example, when Tattershall Castle was \"\n- built between 1430 and 1450, there was plenty of stone available nearby, however the owner, Lord Cromwell, chose to use brick. About 700,000 bricks were used to\n- \" built the castle, which has been described as \\xE2\\x80\\x9Cthe finest piece of medieval brick-work in England\\xE2\\x80\\x9D.[112] Brick castles were predominant in Scandinavia and \"\n- |-\n the Baltic;[113] Denmark had few quarries, and as a result, most of its castles are earth and timber affairs, or later on built from brick.[114]\n [edit] Social c\n- |\n entre\n Main article: Court (royal)\n \n \n \n \n God Speed! by Edmund Blair Leighton, 1900: a late Victorian view of a lady giving a favour to a knight about to do battle\n\n- \"\\n\\n\\\n Due to the lord\'s presence in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as \"\n- \"without the support of his more powerful tennants, a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately \"\n- below them on the social scale, but absentee lords found their power weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit a\n- ll his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.[115] To allow the l\n- ord to concentrate on his duties regarding administration, he had a household of servants to take care of chores such as providing food. The household was run b\n- y a chamberlain, while a treasurer took care of the estate\'s written records. Royal households took essentially the same form as baronial households, although o\n- n a much larger scale and the positions were more prestigious.[116] Without the presence of a lord\'s household, usually because he was staying elsewhere, a cast\n- le would have been a quiet place with few residents, focused on maintaining the castle.[117] Not just a utilitarian structure, as social centres castles were al\n- \"so important places for display. Builders took the opportunity to draw on symbolism to evoke a sense of chivalry that was aspired to in the Middle Ages amongst \"\n- \"the elite. Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features.[118] The \"\n- \"right to crenelate, when granted by a monarch&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 though it was not always necessary&amp;bsp;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was important not just as it allowed a lord to defend his \"\n- \"property but because crenelations and other accoutrements associated with castles were prestigious through their use by the elite.[119]\\n\\\n The purpose of marriage \"\n- \"between the medieval elites was to secure land, not for love; girls were married in their teens, but boys did not marry until they came of age.[120] There is a \"\n- popular conception that women played a peripheral role in the medieval castle household, and that it was dominated by the lord himself. This derives from the im\n- age of the castle as a martial institution, but most castles in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never involved in conflicts or sieges, so the domest\n- \"ic life is a neglected facet.[121] The lady was given a \\\"marriage portion\\\" of her husband\'s estates&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 usually about a third&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 which were hers for \"\n- life, and her husband would inherit on her death; it was her duty to administer them directly, as the lord administered his own land.[122] Despite generally bei\n- ng excluded from military service, a woman could be in charge of a castle, either on behalf of her lordly husband or if she was widowed. Because of their influe\n- nce within the medieval household women influenced construction and design, sometimes through direct patronage; historian Charles Coulson emphasises the role of\n- \" women in applying \\\"a refined aristocratic taste\\\" to castles due to their long term residence.[123] Courtly love was the eroticisation of love between the nobil\"\n- \"ity. Emphasis was placed on restraint between lovers. It was sometimes in private and was expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments. The legend of \"\n- Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages.[124] It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other,\n- \" although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 Henry I of England had over 20&#160;bast\"\n- \"ards for instance&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.[125]\\n\\\n [edit] Castle landscapes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The approach to Kenilworth Castle, Engl\"\n- |-\n and, was lengthened to form a winding route through a moat and an artificial water landscape.\n \n \n As castles were not simply military buildings but centres of adm\n- inistration and symbols of power, they had a significant impact on the landscape around them. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems d\n- \"ue to their role in managing the lord\'s estate,[126] which gave them greater influence over resources.[127] Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer \"\n- parks and were important in their maintenance. Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, and many were found next to castles. Not only were they practical i\n- |-\n n that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.[128]\n Although sometimes the const\n- \"ruction of a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it is more common for the villages nearby to have grown as a result \"\n- of the presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle.[126] The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confi\n- ned to Europe; when Safad Castle was founded in Galilee, in the Holy Land, during the 13th&#160;century, the nearby town benefited from its presence as people c\n- ould now move freely in the area and the 260&#160;villages locally became profitable.[129] When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local l\n- andscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord.[130] Settlements grew naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of p\n- roximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importa\n- \"nce&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement dep\"\n- |-\n opulated.[131]\n During and shortly after the Norman Conquest of England, castles were inserted into important pre-existing towns to control and subdue the popula\n- ce. They were usually location with reference to any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structur\n- es occupying the desired site. In Lincoln, 166&#160;houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a m\n- oat for the castle. As the military importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and the\n- ir financial and judicial roles.[132] When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11th&#160;and 12th&#160;centuries, settlement in those countr\n- |-\n ies was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns is often linked with the creation of a castle.[133]\n Symbolism in relation to castles and their sett\n- ing was very important, as demonstrated by the proximity of high status features such as fish ponds. Also often found near to a castle, sometimes within its def\n- ences, was the parish church.[134] This has been interpreted as a relationship between the church and feudal lords, where the lords patronised the church, which\n- \" was one of the most important institutions of medieval society.[135] Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military can be\"\n- \" highly symbolic. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 comprising a moat and several satellite ponds&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 forced anyone approaching t\"\n- he castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway.[136] Another example is that of the\n- \" 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advance castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and t\"\n- he moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site look more impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer a\n- round the castle, ensuring they got a good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.[137] This also dem\n- onstrates that licenses to crenellate were not solely about a desire to defend oneself, but to have proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who\n- \" was the one responsible for granting permission.[138]\\n\\\n [edit] Warfare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n A trebuchet at Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau des Baux in France\\n\\n\\n\\\n As a static structure, castles could ofte\"\n- n be avoided as their immediate area of influence was about 400&#160;metres (1,300&#160;ft) and their weapons had a short range even early in the age of artille\n- ry. Although leaving an enemy behind the army would allow them to interfere with communications and make raids in the landscape to harry the army. Garrisons wer\n- e expensive, and as a result often small unless the castle was important.[139] Garrisons were smaller in peace time due to the cost of upkeep, and small castles\n- \" were manned by perhaps a couple of watchmen and gate-guards. Even in war garrisons were not necessarily large as too large a defending force would impair the c\"\n- \"astles ability to withstand a long siege; in 1403 a force of 37&#160;archers successfully defended Caernarfon Castle against two assaults by Owain Glynd\\xC5\\xB5r\'s al\"\n- lies during a long siege.[140] Early on, manning a castle was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later re\n- \"placed with paid forces.[140][141] If it was necessary to control the castle for strategic reasons, an army could lay siege to it and starve the defenders out. \"\n- \"Without relief from an outside source, the defending army would eventually submit, but sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies \"\n- of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later.[142] For th\n- e most heavily fortified sites it was more efficient to starve the garrison out that to assault it. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also a\n- \"pplied to the fortified towns of the day.[143] On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally.[144]\\n\\\n If forced to assault \"\n- \"a castle, there were many options available to the attackers. For wooden structures, such as early motte-and-baileys, fire was a real threat and attempts would \"\n- \"be made to set them on fire.[143] Project weapons had been used since antiquity and the mangonel and petraria&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 from Roman and Oriental origins respectiv\"\n- \"ely&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 were the main two that were used into the Middle Ages. The trebuchet, probably evolved from the petraria in the 13th&#160;century, was the most eff\"\n- \"ective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. \"\n- Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high trajectory of its projectile, and would be protected from direct fi\n- re by the curtain walls.[145] Eventually cannons developed to the point where they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the\n- \" main weapon in siege warfare.[83] Walls could be undermined by the creation of a sap; a mine would be dug to conceal the attackers approach to the wall, with w\"\n- ooden supports to prevent the tunnel from collapsing. When the target had been reached, the supports would be burned, caving in the tunnel and bringing down the\n- \" structure above.[146] Battering rams were also used, usually in the form of a tree trunk given an iron cap. They were used to batter down the castle gates, alt\"\n- \"hough they were sometimes used against walls, but with less effect.[147] As an alternative to creating a breach in the walls, an escalade could be attempted to \"\n- capture the walls, with fighting along the walkways on the curtain walls;[148] in this instance, attackers would be very vulnerable to arrowfire, particularly f\n- \"rom crossbows or the English longbow.[149]\\n\\\n [edit] See also\\n\\n\\\n Alc\\xC3\\xA1zar (Spanish castles)\\n\\\n Shiro (Japanese fortifications)\\n\\n\\\n [edit] References\\n\\n\\\n Notes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2\"\n- |\n 005, pp.&#160;7, 10.\n ^ Creighton &amp; Higham 2003, p.&#160;6.\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;32.\n ^ Allen Brown 2004, p.&#160;1.\n ^ a b Coulson 2003, p.&#160;16.\n\n- \"^ Liddiard 2005, pp.&#160;15\\xE2\\x80\\x9317.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;47.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, p.&#160;18.\\n\\\n ^ Stephens 1969, pp.&#160;452\\xE2\\x80\\x93475.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, pp.&#160;2, 6\\xE2\\x80\\x93\"\n- \"7.\\n\\\n ^ Creighton &amp; Higham 2003, pp.&#160;6\\xE2\\x80\\x937.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, p.&#160;2.\\n\\\n ^ a b Friar 2003, p.&#160;214.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;55.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Bar\"\n- \"th\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 397\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;22.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, pp.&#160;214, 216.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;105.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Barth\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 399\\n\\\n ^\"\n- \" Friar 2003, p.&#160;163.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;188.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;190.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Barth\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 402-6.

Typicall\n- |-\n y, costs are borne in the majority by government-funded programs.\n Universal health care systems vary according to the extent of government involvement in provid\n- ing care and/or health insurance. In some countries, such as the UK, Spain, and the Nordic countries, the government has a high degree of involvement in the com\n- missioning or delivery of health care services and access is based on residence rights not on the purchase of insurance. Others have a much more pluralistic del\n- ivery system based on obligatory health with contributory insurance rates related to salaries or income, and usually funded by employers and beneficiaries joint\n- ly. Sometimes the health funds are derived from a mixture of insurance premiums and government taxes. These insurance based systems tend to have a higher propor\n- \"tion of private medical providers obtaining reimbursement, often at heavily regulated rates, through mutual or publicly owned medical insurers. A few countries \"\n- such as the Netherlands and Switzerland operate via privately owned but heavily regulated private insurers. Americans use the term \"single-payer health care\" to\n- \" describe the pooling of health care funds into a single not-for-profit fund for a region or nation.

In Britain, the National Insurance Act 1911 marked the first steps there towards universal health care, coverin\n- g most employed persons and their financial dependents and all persons who had been continuous contributors to the scheme for at least five years whether they w\n- ere working or not. This system of health insurance continued in force until the creation of the National Health Service in 1948 which extended health care secu\n- rity to all legal residents. Most current universal health care systems were implemented in the period following the Second World War as a process of deliberate\n- \" healthcare reform, intended to make health care available to all, in the spirit of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, signed by e\"\n- |-\n very country doing so. The US did not ratify the social and economic rights sections, including Article 25\'s right to health.[2]\n [edit] Implementation and Compa\n- |-\n risons\n See also: Health care system\n Universal health care is a broad concept that has been implemented in several ways. The common denominator for all such prog\n- rams is some form of government action aimed at extending access to health care as widely as possible and setting minimum standards. Most implement universal he\n- alth care through legislation, regulation and taxation. Legislation and regulation direct what care must be provided, to whom, and on what basis. Usually some c\n- osts are borne by the patient at the time of consumption but the bulk of costs come from a combination of compulsory insurance and tax revenues. Some programs a\n- re paid for entirely out of tax revenues. In others tax revenues are used either to fund insurance for the very poor or for those needing long term chronic care\n- \".

The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS), is a new 2005 initiative to overhaul the healthcare system, particularly int\n- ended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, the annual cost of medical cover is 50 yuan (US$7) per person. Of that, 20 yuan is paid i\n- \"n by the central government, 20 yuan by the provincial government and a contribution of 10 yuan is made by the patient. As of September 2007, around 80% of the \"\n- whole rural population of China had signed up (about 685 million people). The system is tiered, depending on the location. If patients go to a small hospital or\n- \" clinic in their local town, the scheme will cover from 70-80% of their bill. If they go to a county one, the percentage of the cost being covered falls to abou\"\n- \"t 60%. And if they need specialist help in a large modern city hospital, they have to bear most of the cost themselves, the scheme would cover about 30% of the \"\n- \"bill.[30]\\n\\\n On January 21, 2009, the Chinese government announced that a total of 850 billion yuan will be provided between 2009 and 2011 in order to improve the \"\n- \"existing health care system.[31]\\n\\\n [edit] Hong Kong SAR\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in Hong Kong\\n\\\n Hong Kong is one of the healthiest places in the world.[32] Because \"\n- of its early health education, professional health services, and well-developed health care and medication system, Hongkongers enjoy a life expectancy of 84 for\n- \" females and 78 for males,[33] which is the second highest in the world, and 2.94 infant mortality rate, the fourth lowest in the world.[34][35]\\n\\\n There are two m\"\n- \"edical schools in Hong Kong, and several schools offering courses in traditional Chinese medicine. The Hospital Authority is a statutory body that operates and \"\n- \"manages all public hospitals. Hong Kong has high standards of medical practice.

The government hospitals, some of which are among the best hospitals in India,[37] provide treat\n- |-\n ment at taxpayer expense. Most essential drugs are offered free of charge in these hospitals.\n Government hospitals provide treatment either free or at minimal c\n- harges. For example, an outpatient card at AIIMS (one of the best hospitals in India) costs a one time fee of rupees 10 (Around 20 cents US) and thereafter outp\n- atient medical advice is free. In-hospital treatment costs depend on financial condition of the patient and facilities utilized by him but are usually much less\n- \" than the private sector. For instance, a patient is waived treatment costs if he is below poverty line. Another patient may seek for an air-conditioned room if\"\n- \" he is willing to pay extra for it. The charges for basic in-hospital treatment and investigations are much less compared to the private sector. The cost for th\"\n- |-\n ese subsidies comes from annual allocations from the central and state governments.\n Primary health care is provided by city and district hospitals and rural pri\n- mary health centres (PHCs). These hospitals provide treatment free of cost. Primary care is focused on immunization, prevention of malnutrition, pregnancy, chil\n- d birth, postnatal care, and treatment of common illnesses.[citation needed] Patients who receive specialized care or have complicated illnesses are referred to\n- \" secondary (often located in district and taluk headquarters) and tertiary care hospitals (located in district and state headquarters or those that are teaching\"\n- \" hospitals).[citation needed] However, the fact that the government sector is understaffed and underfinanced and poor services at state run hospitals forces man\"\n- |-\n y people to visit private medical practitioners.\n Now organizations like Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotional Trust and other private organizations have s\n- |-\n tarted creating hospitals and clinics in India, which also provide free or subsidized health care and subsidized insurance plans.[citation needed]\n [edit] Israel\n- |-\n \n Main article: Health care in Israel\n \n \n \n \n \n This section does not cite any references or sources.

(October 2009)\\n\\n\\n\\\n In Israel, the National Health Insurance Law (or National Health Insurance Act) is \"\n- the legal framework which enables and facilitates basic, compulsory universal health care. The Law was put into effect by the Knesset on January 1, 1995, and wa\n- s based on recommendations put forward by a National Committee of Inquiry which examined restructuring the health care system in Israel in the late 1980s. Prior\n- \" to the law\'s passage approximately 85% of the population was already covered by voluntarily belonging to one of four nation-wide, not-for-profit health mainten\"\n- ance organizations (HMOs/sick funds). However, there were three problems associated with this arrangement. First, membership in the largest HMO, Clalit, require\n- \"d one to belong to the Histadrut labor organization, even if a person did not wish to (or could not) have such an affiliation while other HMOs restricted entry \"\n- to new members based on age, pre-existing conditions or other factors. Second, different HMOs provided different levels of benefit coverage or services to their\n- \" members and lastly was the issue mentioned above whereby a certain percentage of the population, albeit a small one, did not have health insurance coverage at \"\n- |-\n all.\n \n \n \n \n \n This section may stray from the topic of the article&#160;into the topic of another article, Health care in Israel. Please help improve this section o\n- |-\n r discuss this issue on the talk page.\n \n \n Before the law went into effect, all the HMOs collected premiums directly from members. However, upon passage of the la\n- w, a new progressive national health insurance tax was levied through Israel\'s social security agency which then re-distributes the proceeds to the HMOs based o\n- n their membership and its demographic makeup. This ensured that all citizens would now have health coverage. While membership in one of the HMOs now became com\n- pulsory for all, free choice was introduced into movement of members between HMOs (a change is allowed once per year), effectively making the various HMOs compe\n- te equally for members among the populace. Annually, a committee appointed by the ministry of health publishes a \"basket\" or uniform package of medical services\n- \" and prescription formulary which all HMOs must provide as a minimum service to all their members. Achieving this level of equality ensured that all citizens ar\"\n- e guaranteed to receive basic healthcare regardless of their HMO affiliation which was one of the principal aims of the law. An appeals process was put in place\n- \" to handle rejection of treatments and procedures by the HMOs and evaluating cases falling outside the \\\"basket\\\" of services or prescription formulary.\\n\\\n While the\"\n- \" law is generally considered a success and Israeli citizens enjoy a high standard of medical care comparatively, with more competition having been introduced in\"\n- \"to the field of health care in the country, and order having been brought into what was once a somewhat disorganized system, the law nevertheless does have its \"\n- critics. First and foremost among the criticisms raised is that the \"basket\" may not provide enough coverage. To partly address this issue, the HMOs and insuran\n- \"ce companies (often in conjunction with employers) began offering additional \\\"supplementary\\\" insurance to cover certain additional services not included in the \"\n- \"basket. However, since this insurance is optional, critics argue that it goes against the spirit of the new law which stressed equality among all citizens with \"\n- respect to healthcare. Another criticism is that in order to provide universal coverage to all, the tax income base amount (the maximum amount of yearly earning\n- s that are subject to the tax) was set rather high, causing many high-income taxpayers to see the amount they pay for their health premiums (now health tax) sky\n- |-\n rocket. Finally, some complain about the constantly rising costs of copayments for certain services.\n [edit] Singapore\n Main article: Health care in Singapore\n Sin\n- gapore has a universal health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through compulsory savings and price controls, while the private secto\n- r provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources.[38] Singapore currently has the\n- \" lowest infant mortality rate in the world (equaled only by Iceland) and among the highest life expectancies from birth, according to the World Health Organizat\"\n- ion.[39] Singapore has \"one of the most successful healthcare systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in communi\n- ty health outcomes,\" according to an analysis by global consulting firm Watson Wyatt.[40] Singapore\'s system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payro\n- \"ll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as \\\"actively regulating the supply \"\n- and prices of healthcare services in the country\" to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a \"very difficult system to r\n- eplicate in many other countries.\" Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by t\n- \"he government\'s programs.[40]\\n\\\n [edit] Taiwan (Republic of China)\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in Taiwan\\n\\\n The current health care system in Taiwan, known as National \"\n- Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars\n- . The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.[41] NHI is mainly financed t\n- hrough premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-fo\n- |-\n r-service predominated for both public and private providers.\n NHI delivers universal coverage offered by a government-run insurer. The working population pays p\n- \"remiums split with their employers, others pay a flat rate with government help and the poor or veterans are fully subsidized. Taiwan\\xE2\\x80\\x99s citizens no longer hav\"\n- |-\n e to worry about going bankrupt due to medical bills.[42]\n Under this model, citizens have free range to choose hospitals and physicians without using a gatekeep\n- \"er and do not have to worry about waiting lists. NHI offers a comprehensive benefit package that covers preventive medical services, prescription drugs, dental \"\n- \"services, Chinese medicine, home nurse visits and many more. Working people do not have to worry about losing their jobs or changing jobs because they will not \"\n- lose their insurance. Since NHI, the previously uninsured have increased their usage of medical services. Most preventive services are free such as annual check\n- \"ups and maternal and child care. Regular office visits have co-payments as low as US $5 per visit. Co-payments are fixed and unvaried by the person\\xE2\\x80\\x99s income.[\"\n- |-\n 43]\n [edit] Thailand\n Main article: Health care in Thailand\n Thailand introduced universal coverage reforms in 2001, becoming one of only a handful of lower-middle\n- \" income countries to do so. Means-tested health care for low income households was replaced by a new and more comprehensive insurance scheme, originally known a\"\n- s the 30 baht project, in line with the small co-payment charged for treatment. People joining the scheme receive a gold card which allows them to access servic\n- es in their health district, and, if necessary, be referred for specialist treatment elsewhere. The bulk of finance comes from public revenues, with funding all\n- ocated to Contracting Units for Primary Care annually on a population basis. According to the WHO, 65% of Thailand\'s health care expenditure in 2004 came from t\n- he government, 35% was from private sources.[38] Although the reforms have received a good deal of critical comment, they have proved popular with poorer Thais,\n- \" especially in rural areas, and survived the change of government after the 2006 military coup. The then Public Health Minister, Mongkol Na Songkhla, abolished \"\n- \"the 30 baht co-payment and made the UC scheme free. It is not yet clear whether the scheme will be modified further under the coalition government that came to \"\n- |-\n power in January 2008.[44][45][46]\n [edit] Europe\n Virtually all of Europe has publicly sponsored and regulated universal health care. The public plans in some co\n- \"untries provide basic or \\\"sick\\\" coverage only; their citizens can purchase supplemental insurance for additional coverage. Countries with universal health care \"\n- include Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, I\n- celand, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal,[47] Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, S\n- |-\n lovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine[48] and the United Kingdom.[49]\n [edit] Austria\n In Austria, public health care (the care, not the running of hospita\n- ls itself) is funded by means of so called \"Social insurance contributions\" accounting for approx. 24% of the salary, they are therefore no taxes as such. 7% of\n- \" the contribution is reserved for health coverage in one of Austria\'s 22 public insurances, but cannot exceed EUR 281,- monthly (USD 399,-). Depending on the jo\"\n- b, somebody will be insured at one of the 9 state-run territorial health funds or at job specific insurances, e.g. public employees or farmers have their own (c\n- ompulsory) health insurance. 22 public insurances for 8 million people is subject to violent criticism, as tremendous savings could be reached by unifying the i\n- nsurances to one centralized provider. However, no Austrian state is willing to give up its own public insurances as it is sphere of action for electoral campai\n- gns. The operation of hospitals is not paid by social contributions, but by taxes. This means that general health coverage adds up to much more and is therefore\n- \" more expensive as often depicted. Austria spends approx. 10% of its GDP for health coverage.\\n\\\n [edit] Finland\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in Finland\\n\\\n In Finland, pub\"\n- lic medical services at clinics and hospitals are run by the municipalities (local government) and are funded 76% by taxation, 20% by patients through access ch\n- arges, and 4% by others. Private provision is mainly in the primary care sector. There are a few private hospitals [50]. The main hospitals are either municipal\n- \"ly owned (funded from local taxes) or run by the medical teaching universities (funded jointly by the municipalities and the national government). According to \"\n- \"a survey published by the European Commission in 2000, Finland\'s is in the top 4 of EU countries in terms of satisfaction with their hospital care system: 88% o\"\n- f Finnish respondents were satisfied compared with the EU average of 41.3%.[51] Finnish health care expenditures are below the European average.[citation needed\n- \"] The private medical sector accounts for about 14 percent of total health care spending. Only 8% of doctors choose to work in private practice, and some of the\"\n- |-\n se also choose to do some work in the public sector.[citation needed]\n Taxation funding is partly local and partly nationally based. The national social insuranc\n- e institution KELA reimburses part of patients prescription costs and makes a contribution towards private medical costs (including dentistry) if they choose to\n- \" be treated in the private sector rather than the public sector. Patient access charges are subject to annual caps. For example GP visits cost \\xE2\\x82\\xAC11 per visit w\"\n- \"ith annual \\xE2\\x82\\xAC33 cap; hospital outpatient treatment \\xE2\\x82\\xAC22 per visit; a hospital stay, including food, medical care and medicines \\xE2\\x82\\xAC26 per 24 hours, or \\xE2\\x82\\xAC12 if\"\n- \" in a psychiatric hospital. After a patient has spent \\xE2\\x82\\xAC590 per year on public medical services (including prescription drugs), all treatment and medications t\"\n- |-\n hereafter in that year are free.\n [edit] Germany\n Main article: Health care in Germany\n Germany has the world\'s oldest universal health care system, with origins d\n- \"ating back to Otto von Bismarck\'s Health Insurance Act of 1883.[52] As mandatory health insurance, it originally applied only to low-income workers and certain \"\n- government employees, but has gradually expanded to cover the great majority of the population.[53] The system is decentralized with private practice physicians\n- \" providing ambulatory care, and independent, mostly non-profit hospitals providing the majority of inpatient care. Approximately 92% of the population is covere\"\n- d by a \'Statutory Health Insurance\' plan, which provides a standardized level of coverage through any one of approximately 1100 public or private sickness funds\n- . Standard insurance is funded by a combination of employee contributions, employer contributions and government subsidies on a scale determined by income level\n- . Higher income workers sometimes choose to pay a tax and opt out of the standard plan, in favor of \'private\' insurance. The latter\'s premiums are not linked to\n- \" income level but instead to health status.[54]\\n\\\n Historically, the level of provider reimbursement for specific services is determined through negotiations betwe\"\n- \"en regional physician\'s associations and sickness funds. Since 1976 the government has convened an annual commission, comprised of representatives of business, \"\n- labor, physicians, hospitals, and insurance and pharmaceutical industries.[55] The commission takes into account government policies and makes recommendations t\n- \"o regional associations with respect to overall expenditure targets. In 1986 expenditure caps were implemented and were tied to the age of the local population \"\n- as well as the overall wage increases. Although reimbursement of providers is on a fee-for-service basis the amount to be reimbursed for each service is determi\n- ned retrospectively to ensure that spending targets are not exceeded. Capitated care, such as that provided by U.S. health maintenance organizations, has been c\n- onsidered as a cost containment mechanism but would require consent of regional medical associations, and has not materialized.[56] Copayments were introduced i\n- n the 1980s in an attempt to prevent overutilization and control costs. The average length of hospital stay in Germany has decreased in recent years from 14 day\n- s to 9 days, still considerably longer than average stays in the U.S. (5 to 6 days).[57][58] The difference is partly driven by the fact that hospital reimburse\n- ment is chiefly a function of the number of hospital days as opposed to procedures or the patient\'s diagnosis. Drug costs have increased substantially, rising n\n- \"early 60% from 1991 through 2005. Despite attempts to contain costs, overall health care expenditures rose to 10.7% of GDP in 2005, comparable to other western \"\n- |-\n European nations, but substantially less than that spent in the U.S. (nearly 16% of GDP).[59]\n [edit] Ireland\n Main article: Health care in Ireland\n The public hea\n- \"lth care system of the Republic of Ireland is governed by the Health Act 2004, which established a new body to be responsible for providing health and personal \"\n- social services to everyone living in Ireland - the Health Service Executive. The new national health service came into being officially on 1 January 2005; howe\n- ver the new structures are currently in the process of being established as the reform programme continues. In addition to the public-sector, there is also a la\n- |-\n rge private healthcare market.\n [edit] Netherlands\n Main article: Health care in the Netherlands\n The Netherlands has a dual-level system. All primary and curative\n- \" care (i.e. the family doctor service and hospitals and clinics) is financed from private compulsory insurance. Long term care for the elderly, the dying, the l\"\n- ong term mentally ill etc. is covered by social insurance funded from taxation. According to the WHO, the health care system in the Netherlands was 62% governme\n- |-\n nt funded and 38% privately funded as of 2004.[38]\n Insurance companies must offer a core universal insurance package for the universal primary, curative care wh\n- ich includes the cost of all prescription medicines. They must do this at a fixed price for all. The same premium is paid whether young or old, healthy or sick.\n- \" It is illegal in The Netherlands for insurers to refuse an application for health insurance, to impose special conditions (e.g. exclusions, deductibles, co-pay\"\n- \"s etc or refuse to fund treatments which a doctor has determined to be medically necessary). The system is 50% financed from payroll taxes paid by employers to \"\n- \"a fund controlled by the Health regulator. The government contributes an additional 5% to the regulator\'s fund. The remaining 45% is collected as premiums paid \"\n- by the insured directly to the insurance company. Some employers negotiate bulk deals with health insurers and some even pay the employees\' premiums as an emplo\n- yment benefit). All insurance companies receive additional funding from the regulator\'s fund. The regulator has sight of the claims made by policyholders and th\n- \"erefore can redistribute the funds its holds on the basis of relative claims made by policy holders. Thus insurers with high payouts will receive more from the \"\n- regulator than those with low payouts. Thus insurance companies have no incentive to deter high cost individuals from taking insurance and are compensated if th\n- ey have to pay out more than might be expected. Insurance companies compete with each other on price for the 45% direct premium part of the funding and try to n\n- \"egotiate deals with hospitals to keep costs low and quality high. The competition regulator is charged with checking for abuse of dominant market positions and \"\n- the creation of cartels that act against the consumer interests. An insurance regulator ensures that all basic policies have identical coverage rules so that no\n- \" person is medically disadvantaged by his or her choice of insurer.\\n\\\n Hospitals in the Netherlands are also regulated and inspected but are mostly privately run a\"\n- nd for profit, as are many of the insurance companies. Patients can choose where they want to be treated and have access to information on the internet about th\n- e performance and waiting times at each hospital. Patients dissatisfied with their insurer and choice of hospital can cancel at any time but must make a new agr\n- |-\n eement with another insurer.\n Insurance companies can offer additional services at extra cost over and above the universal system laid down by the regulator, e.g\n- \". for dental care. The standard monthly premium for health care paid by individual adults is about \\xE2\\x82\\xAC100 per month. Persons on low incomes can get assistance f\"\n- rom the government if they cannot afford these payments. Children under 18 are insured by the system at no additional cost to them or their families because the\n- \" insurance company receives the cost of this from the regulator\'s fund.\\n\\\n [edit] United Kingdom\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in the United Kingdom\\n\\\n Each of the Countri\"\n- \"es of the United Kingdom has a National Health Service that provides public healthcare to all UK permanent residents that is free at the point of need and paid \"\n- for from general taxation. However, since Health is a devolved matter, considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries.[60]\n- |-\n \n [edit] England\n Main article: Healthcare in England\n The National Health Service (NHS), created by the National Health Service Act 1946 has provided the majority\n- \" of healthcare in England since its launch on 5 July 1948.\\n\\\n The NHS Constitution for England documents at high level, the objectives of the NHS, the legal rights\"\n- \" and responsibilities of the various parties (patients, staff, NHS trust boards) and the guiding principles which govern the service.[61] The NHS constitution m\"\n- \"akes it clear that it provides a comprehensive service, available to all irrespective of age, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, religion or belief; \"\n- \"that access to NHS services is based on clinical need and not an individual\\xE2\\x80\\x99s ability to pay; and that care is never refused on unreasonable grounds. Patient \"\n- choice in terms of doctor, care, treatments and place of treatment is an important aspect of the NHS\'s ambition, and in some cases patients can elect for treatm\n- ent in other European countries at the NHS\'s expense. Wait times are low, with most people able to see their primary care doctor on the same day or the followin\n- g day[62] and only 36.1% of hospital admissions are from a waiting list, with the remainder being either emergencies admitted immediately or else pre-booked adm\n- issions or similar (e.g. child birth) [63]. No patient should experience a delay of more than 18 weeks from initial hospital referral to final treatment[64]. Th\n- |-\n is includes the time for all investigative tests and consultations, and two thirds of patients are currently treated in under 12 weeks.[65]\n Although centrally f\n- \"unded there is no large central bureaucracy to manage it. Responsibility is highly devolved to geographical areas through Strategic Health Authorities and even \"\n- more locally through NHS primary care trusts , NHS hospital trusts and increasingly to NHS foundation trusts which are providing even more decentralized service\n- s within the NHS framework, with more decision making taken by local people, patients and staff. The central government office, the Department of Health, is not\n- \" involved in day to day decision making in either the Strategic Health Authorities or the individual local trusts (primarily health, hospital or ambulance) or t\"\n- he national specialist trusts such as NHS Blood and Transplant, but it does lay down general guidelines for them to follow. Local trusts are accountable to thei\n- |-\n r local populations, whilst government ministers are accountable to Parliament for the service overall.\n The NHS provides, among other things, primary care, in-p\n- \"atient care, long-term healthcare, psychiatric care and treatments ophthalmology and dentistry. All treatment is free with the exception of certain charges for \"\n- prescriptions, dentistry and ophthalmology (which themselves are free to children, the elderly, the unemployed and those on low incomes). Eighty-nine percent of\n- \" NHS prescriptions are obtained free of charge, mosly children, pensioners and pregnat women. Others pay a flat rate of \\xC2\\xA37.20[66], and others may cap their ann\"\n- ual charges. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance. Private insurance accounts for only 4 percent of heal\n- th expenditure and covers little more than a tenth of the population. [67]. Private insurers in the UK only cover acute care from specialists. They do not cover\n- \" generalist consultations, pre-existing conditions, medical emergencies, organ transplants, chronic conditions such as diabetes or conditions such as pregnancy \"\n- or HIV. [68] Most NHS general practitioners are private doctors who contract to provide NHS services but most hospitals are publicly owned and run through NHS T\n- rusts. A few NHS medical services such as \"surgicentres\") are sub-contracted to private providers [69] as are some non-medical services (such as catering). Some\n- \" capital projects such as new hospitals have been funded through the Private Finance Initiative, enabling investment without excessive strain on the public sect\"\n- |-\n or borrowing requirement.\n [edit] Northern Ireland\n Main article: Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland\n Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland is the des\n- |-\n ignation of the national public health service in Northern Ireland.\n [edit] Scotland\n Main article: Healthcare in Scotland\n NHS Scotland, created by the National H\n- ealth Service (Scotland) Act 1947, was also launched on 5 July 1948 though it has always been a separate organisation. Since devolution, NHS Scotland follows th\n- |-\n e policies and priorities of the Scottish Government, including the phasing out of all prescription charges by 2011.\n [edit] Wales\n Main article: Healthcare in Wa\n- |-\n les\n NHS Wales was originally formed as part of the same NHS structure created by the National Health Service Act 1946 but powers over the NHS in Wales came unde\n- |-\n r the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969[70], in turn being transferred under devolution to what is now the Welsh Assembly Government.\n [edit] Oceania\n [edit] A\n- \"ustralia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Medicare\'s logo\\n\\n\\n\\\n Main article: Medicare (Australia)\\n\\\n In Australia, Medibank \\xE2\\x80\\x94 as it was then known \\xE2\\x80\\x94 was introduced, by the Whitlam Labor gover\"\n- nment on 1 July 1975, through the Health Insurance Act 1973. The Australian Senate rejected the changes multiple times and they were passed only after a joint s\n- itting after the 1974 double dissolution election. However, Medibank was supported by the subsequent Fraser Coalition (Australia) government and became a key fe\n- \"ature of Australia\\xE2\\x80\\x99s public policy landscape. The exact structure of Medibank/Medicare, in terms of the size of the rebate to doctors and hospitals and the wa\"\n- y it has administered, has varied over the years. The original Medibank program proposed a 1.35% levy (with low income exemptions) but these bills were rejected\n- \" by the Senate, and so Medibank was funded from general taxation. In 1976, the Fraser Government introduced a 2.5% levy and split Medibank in two: a universal s\"\n- |-\n cheme called Medibank Public and a government-owned private health insurance company, Medibank Private.\n During the 1980s, Medibank Public was renamed Medicare b\n- y the Hawke Labor government, which also changed the funding model, to an income tax surcharge, known as the Medicare Levy, which was set at 1.5%, with exemptio\n- ns for low income earners.[71] The Howard Coalition government introduced an additional levy of 1.0%, known as the Medicare Levy Surcharge, for those on high an\n- nual incomes ($70,000) and do not have adequate levels of private hospital coverage.[72] This was part of an effort by the Coalition to encourage take-up of pri\n- vate health insurance. According to WHO, government funding covered 67.5% of Australia\'s health care expenditures in 2004; private sources covered the remaining\n- \" 32.5% of expenditures.[38]\\n\\\n [edit] New Zealand\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in New Zealand\\n\\\n As with Australia, New Zealand\'s healthcare system is funded through gen\"\n- eral taxation. According to the WHO, government sources covered 77.4% of New Zealand\'s health care costs in 2004; private expenditures covered the remaining 22.\n- |-\n 6%.[38]\n [edit] Economics\n Main article: Health care economics\n [edit] Funding models\n Universal health care in most countries has been achieved by a mixed model of\n- \" funding. General taxation revenue is the primary source of funding, but in many countries it is supplemented by specific levies (which may be charged to the in\"\n- dividual and/or an employer) or with the option of private payments (either direct or via optional insurance) for services beyond that covered by the public sys\n- |-\n tem.\n Almost all European systems are financed through a mix of public and private contributions.[73] The majority of universal health care systems are funded pr\n- imarily by tax revenue (e.g. Portugal[73] and Spain). Some nations, such as Germany, France[49] and Japan[74] employ a multi-payer system in which health care i\n- s funded by private and public contributions. However, much of the non-government funding is by defined contributions by employers and employees to regulated no\n- |-\n n-profit sickness funds. These contributions are compulsory and vary according to a person\'s salary, and are effectively a form of hypothecated taxation.\n A dist\n- inction is also made between municipal and national healthcare funding. For example, one model is that the bulk of the healthcare is funded by the municipality,\n- \" speciality healthcare is provided and possibly funded by a larger entity, such as a municipal co-operation board or the state, and the medications are paid by \"\n- |-\n a state agency.\n Universal health care systems are modestly redistributive. Progressivity of health care financing has limited implications for overall income in\n- |-\n equality.[75]\n [edit] Single-payer\n Main article: Single-payer health care\n The term single-payer health care is used in the United States to describe a funding me\n- chanism meeting the costs of medical care from a single fund. Although the fund holder is usually the government, some forms of single-payer employ a public-pri\n- |-\n vate system.\n [edit] Public\n Some countries (notably the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain) have eliminated insurance entirely and choose to fund health care direct\n- ly from taxation. Other countries with insurance-based systems effectively meet the cost of insuring those unable to insure themselves via social security arran\n- |\n gements funded from taxation, either by directly paying their medical bills or by paying for insurance premiums for those affected.\n [edit] Compulsory insurance\n\n- This is usually enforced via legislation requiring residents to purchase insurance, though sometimes, in effect, the government provides the insurance. Sometime\n- s there may be a choice of multiple public and private funds providing a standard service (e.g. as in Germany) or sometimes just a single public fund (as in Can\n- |-\n ada).\n In some European countries where there is private insurance and universal health care, such as Germany, Belgium, and The Netherlands, the problem of adver\n- se selection (see Private insurance below) is overcome using a risk compensation pool to equalize, as far as possible, the risks between funds. Thus a fund with\n- \" a predominantly healthy, younger population has to pay into a compensation pool and a fund with an older and predominantly less healthy population would receiv\"\n- e funds from the pool. In this way, sickness funds compete on price and there is no advantage to eliminate people with higher risks because they are compensated\n- \" for by means of risk-adjusted capitation payments. Funds are not allowed to pick and choose their policyholders or deny coverage, but then mainly compete on pr\"\n- |-\n ice and service. In some countries the basic coverage level is set by the government and cannot be modified.[76]\n Ireland at one time had a \"community rating\" sy\n- \"stem through VHI, effectively a single-payer or common risk pool. The government later opened VHI to competition but without a compensation pool. This resulted \"\n- in foreign insurance companies entering the Irish market and offering cheap health insurance to relatively healthy segments of the market which then made higher\n- \" profits at VHI\'s expense. The government later re-introduced community rating through a pooling arrangement and at least one main major insurance company, BUPA\"\n- \", then withdrew from the Irish market.\\n\\\n [edit] Private insurance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n This article may be inaccurate in or unbalanced towards certain viewpoints. Please improve \"\n- |-\n the article by adding information on neglected viewpoints, or discuss the issue on the talk page. (June 2009)\n \n \n In some countries with universal coverage, priva\n- te insurance often excludes many health conditions which are expensive and which the state health care system can provide. For example in the UK, one of the lar\n- |-\n gest private health care providers is BUPA which has the following list of general exclusions[77].\n Dental/oral treatment (such as fillings, gum disease, jaw shr\n- \"inkage, etc)\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; pregnancy and childbirth\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; temporary relief of symptoms\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; convalescence, rehabilitation and general nursing care\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; drugs and dressings fo\"\n- \"r out-patient or take-home use\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; screening and preventive treatment; birth control, conception, sexual problems and sex changes\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; allergies or allergic diso\"\n- \"rders; chronic conditions\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; eyesight\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; physical aids and devices\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; *deafness; cosmetic, reconstructive or weight loss treatment\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; ageing, menopaus\"\n- \"e and puberty&#160;; dialysis\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; complications from excluded or restricted conditions/ treatment&#160;; HRT and bone densitometry\\xE2\\x80\\xA0; learning difficulti\"\n- \"es, behavioural and developmental problems&#160;; overseas treatment and repatriation&#160;; AIDS/HIV\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; pre-existing or special conditions&#160;; experi\"\n- \"mental drugs and treatment\\xE2\\x80\\xA0&#160;; sleep problems and disorders&#160;; speech disorders\\xE2\\x80\\xA0\\n\\\n all of which (except overseas repatriation) are available for free \"\n- \"or very low cost from the NHS. (\\xE2\\x80\\xA0 indicates that treatment may be provided in certain circumstances)\\n\\\n Where voluntary insurance (often private) is predominant,\"\n- \" such as in the U.S., medical (health) insurance is subject to the well-known economic problem of adverse selection which may also be referred to as a market fa\"\n- ilure.[citation needed] Adverse selection in insurance markets occurs because those providing insurance have limited information with which to estimate the heal\n- th risks on which they may need to pay future claims.[citation needed] In simple terms, those with poor health are more likely to apply for insurance and more l\n- ikely to need treatments requiring high insurance company payouts.[citation needed] Those with good health may find the cost of insurance too high for the perce\n- ived benefit, and some will remove themselves from the risk pool.[citation needed] This adverse selection concentrates the risk pool, thereby further raising co\n- sts.[citation needed] In practical terms, the potential for adverse selection means that private insurers have an economic incentive to use medical underwriting\n- \" to \'weed out\' high cost applicants in order to avoid adverse selection.[citation needed] Among the potential solutions posited by economists are single payer s\"\n- ystems as well as other methods of ensuring that health insurance is universal, such as by requiring all citizens to purchase insurance and limiting the ability\n- \" of insurance companies to deny insurance to individuals or vary price between individuals.[78][79]\\n\\n\\\n [edit] See also\\n\\n\\\n Health care compared - tabular comparisons\"\n- \" of the US, Canada, and other countries not shown above.\\n\\\n Health care reform debate in the United States\\n\\\n Health insurance cooperative\\n\\\n Millennium Development Goal\"\n- |-\n s\n National health insurance\n Publicly-funded health care\n Single-payer health care\n \n [edit] References\n \n \n ^ a b Insuring America\'s Health: Principles and Recommenda\n- |-\n tions, Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science, 2004-01-14\n ^ \"Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Questions and Answers\" (PDF).

The term has a history of scholarly debate surrounding its precise meaning, but a castle is usually considered to be the \"private fortif\n- ied residence\" of a lord or noble. This is distinct from a fortress, which was not a home, or a fortified town, which was a public defence. Over the extended pe\n- riod of time that castles were built they took on a great many forms with many different features, but some, such as the curtain wall and arrow slits, were comm\n- |-\n onplace.\n Castles originated in the 9th&#160;and 10th&#160;centuries, when the fall of the Carolingian Empire in Europe and the rise of feudal society led to the\n- \" territory of the collapsing empire being divided between individual lords and princes, and an emphasis on personal defence. Castles controlled their immediate \"\n- areas, and were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as protection from an enemy. Although t\n- \"heir military origins are often emphasised, castles also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local \"\n- |-\n populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near elements such as a mill, integral to life in the community.\n Many castles were o\n- riginally built from earth and timber, and had their defences replaced later by stone equivalents. In the late 12th&#160;and early 13th&#160;century, a scientif\n- ic approach to castle defence emerged. Towers proliferated, with an emphasis on flanking fire, and many new castles were polygonal, while previously they had re\n- \"lied more on the lay of the land and were curvilinear, or relied on concentric defence&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 several stages of defence within each other that could all funct\"\n- ion at the same time, thereby maximising the castle\'s firepower. The origin of these changes in defence has been attributed to a mixture of influence from the C\n- \"rusades&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 where castle technology was advanced such as the new type of concentric fortification&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and drawing on earlier defences such as Roman fo\"\n- rts for inspiration. Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, and devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defen\n- |-\n ce into symbols of power. Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress, and to dominate their landscape.\n Gunpowder, introduced to Europe i\n- n the 14th&#160;century, did not have an immediate impact on castle building. Castles do not show adaptation to resist bombardment by cannons until the 15th&#16\n- \"0;century, when artillery became powerful enough to break down walls. Although castles were built across Europe well into the 16th&#160;century, new techniques \"\n- to deal with improved cannon eventually led to them becoming uncomfortable and undesirable places to live, and so true castles went into decline, replaced by ar\n- tillery forts with no role in administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18th&#160;century onwards, there was a renewed interest in cas\n- |-\n tles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no defensive purpose.\n \n \n \n \n Contents\n \n \n 1 Definition\n \n 1\n- |-\n .1 Etymology\n 1.2 Defining characteristics\n \n \n 2 Common features\n \n 2.1 Motte\n 2.2 Bailey and enceinte\n 2.3 Keep\n 2.4 Curtain wall\n 2.5 Moat\n 2.6 Gatehouse\n 2.7 Other feat\n- |+\n ures\n \n \n 3 History\n \n 3.1 Antecedents\n 3.2 Origins and early castles\n 3.3 Innovation and scientific design\n 3.4 Advent of gunpowder\n 3.5 Later use and revival castles\n \n- |-\n \n 4 Construction\n 5 Social centre\n 6 Castle landscapes\n 7 Warfare\n 8 See also\n 9 References\n 10 Further reading\n 11 External links\n \n \n \n \n \n //<![CDATA[\n if (window.showTocTo\n- |-\n ggle) { var tocShowText = \"show\"; var tocHideText = \"hide\"; showTocToggle(); } \n //]]>\n \n [edit] Definition\n [edit] Etymology\n \n \n \n \n The Norman \"White Tower\", the keep\n- \" of the Tower of London, exemplifies all uses of a castle: city defence, a residence, and a place of refuge in times of crisis.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Castle is derived from the Lat\"\n- \"in word castellum. This is a diminutive of the word castrum, which means \\\"fortified place\\\". The Old English castel, French ch\\xC3\\xA2teau, Spanish castillo, Italian c\"\n- \"astello, as well as other European words for castle derive from castellum.[2] The word castle was introduced into English shortly before the Norman Conquest to \"\n- denote this type of building, then new to England, introduced to the country by Normans working for Edward the Confessor.[3] Although the various terms used for\n- \" castles in Europe derive from the same root, they are not universally applied to the same types of structures. The French ch\\xC3\\xA2teau is used to describe a grand \"\n- \"country house at the heart of an estate, regardless of the presence of fortifications.[4]\\n\\\n [edit] Defining characteristics\\n\\\n In its simplest terms, the definition \"\n- of a castle accepted amongst academics is \"a private fortified residence\".[5] This contrasts with earlier fortifications, such as Anglo Saxon burhs and walled c\n- \"ities such as Constantinople and Antioch in the Middle East: castles were not communal defences but were built and owned by the local feudal lord, either for th\"\n- emselves of for their monarch.[6] In the late 20th&#160;century, there was a trend to refine the definition of a castle by including the criterion of feudal own\n- ership, thus tying castles to the medieval period. However this does not necessarily reflect what medieval people called castles. During the First Crusade (1096\n- \"\\xE2\\x80\\x931099) the Frankish armies encountered walled settlements and forts that they indiscriminately called castles, but would not be considered such under the mode\"\n- |-\n rn definition.[5]\n \n \n \n \n Windsor Castle in England was first built as a fortification of the Norman Conquest, and today is home to Queen Elizabeth II of the United\n- \" Kingdom.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Castles served a range of purposes, the most important of which were military, administrative, and domestic. Early castles were primarily military i\"\n- \"nstitutions, places of protection from an enemy. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which could be used as a base of operations \"\n- in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England as both defensive and offensive tools to pacify the inhabitants.[7] As William the Co\n- nqueror advanced through England after the Norman Conquest in 1066, he fortifed key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087 he establis\n- hed 36&#160;castles such as Warwick Castle, which was used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.[8][9] However, a recent trend to view castles les\n- s as military institutions and more as social structures has questioned the current definition. During the Middle Ages, castles tended to lose their military si\n- |-\n gnificance and became more important as residences and statements of power.[10]\n In Britain the term \"castle\" has also been erroneously used to refer to Iron Age\n- \" fortifications such as Maiden Castle, Dorset.[11] A castle was not only a bastion and prison but also a place where a knight or lord could entertain his peers.\"\n- \" Over time the aesthetics of the design became more important, as the castle\'s appearance and size began to reflect the prestige and power of its occupant. Cast\"\n- les were built as defensive measures and offensive weapons, but comfortable homes were often fashioned within their fortified walls. Although castles still prov\n- |-\n ided protection from low levels of violence in later periods, eventually they were succeeded by country houses as high status residences.[12]\n [edit] Common feat\n- \"ures\\n\\\n [edit] Motte\\n\\\n Main article: Motte-and-bailey\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The wooden palisades surmounting mottes were often later replaced in stone, as in this example at Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau \"\n- |-\n de Gisors in France.\n \n \n A motte was a mound with a flat top. The mounds were often artificial, although sometimes they incorporated a pre-existing feature of the\n- \" landscape. The excavation of earth for the mound would leave a ditch around the motte, which acted as a further defence. Sometimes a nearby stream would be div\"\n- erted to flood the ditch, creating a moat. Motte and moat derive from the same Old French word, indicating that they were originally associated features and dep\n- \"ended on each other for their construction. Although the motte is usually associated with the bailey to form a motte-and-bailey castle, this was not always the \"\n- \"case and there are instances where a motte existed on its own. \\\"Motte\\\" refers to the mound alone, but it was often surmounted by a fortified structure, such as \"\n- a keep, and the flat top would be surrounded by a palisade.[13] The motte was accessed by a flying bridge as represented by the Bayeux Tapestry\'s depiction of C\n- \"h\\xC3\\xA2teau de Dinan.[14] Sometimes a motte covered an older castle or hall, whose rooms now became underground storage areas and prisons beneath a new donjon.[15]\\n\"\n- |-\n [edit] Bailey and enceinte\n Main article: Enceinte\n A bailey, also called a ward, was a fortified enclosure. They were a common feature of castles, and most had a\n- t least one. The keep on top of the motte was the domicile of the lord in charge of the castle and a bastion of last defence, while the bailey was the home of t\n- \"he rest of the lord\'s household and gave them protection. The barracks for the garrison, stables, workshops, and storage facilities could all be expected to be \"\n- \"found in the bailey. There was a progression for lords to build more comfortable accommodation for themselves within the bailey, which resulted in the creation \"\n- of another bailey that separated the high status buildings such as the lord\'s chambers and the chapel, from the everyday structures such as the workshops and ba\n- rracks.[16] Although often associated with the motte-and-bailey type of castle, baileys could be found as independent defensive structures. These simple fortifi\n- cations were called ringworks.[17] The terms bailey and enceinte are linked, as the enceinte was the castle\'s main defensive enclosure. A castle could have seve\n- ral baileys but only one enceinte. Castles with no keep and which relied on their outer defences for protection are sometimes called enceinte castles;[18] these\n- \" were the earliest form of castles, before the donjon arrived in the 10th century.[19]\\n\\\n [edit] Keep\\n\\\n Main article: Keep\\n\\\n A keep was a great tower and usually the s\"\n- \"trongest point of a castle before the introduction of concentric defence. Keep was not a term used in the medieval period&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the term was applied from the\"\n- \" 16th&#160;century onwards&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and donjon was used to refer to great towers,[20] or turris in Latin. Dungeon is a corrupted form of donjon and means a dark\"\n- \", unwelcoming prison.[21] Although often the strongest part of a castle and a last place of refuge if the outer defences fell, the keep was not left empty in ca\"\n- se of attack but was used as a residence by the lord who owned the castle, or his guests or representatives.[22] Initially this was only the usual pattern in En\n- gland, when after the Norman Conquest of 1066 the \"conquerors lived for a long time in a constant state of alert\"; elsewhere the lord\'s wife presided over a sep\n- \"arate residence (domus, aula or mansio in Latin) close to the keep, and the donjon was a barracks and headquarters. Gradually the two functions merged into the \"\n- same building; for many examples choosing the appropriate term can be difficult, and the highest residential storeys have large windows.[23] In motte-and-bailey\n- \" castles, the keep was on top of the motte.[13]\\n\\\n [edit] Curtain wall\\n\\\n Main article: Curtain wall (fortification)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Carcassonne, France, showing the classic feat\"\n- |-\n ures of the curtain walls, defensive ditch with arched bridge, and cylindrical flanking towers, with a gatehouse and additional wooden defensive structures.\n \n \n C\n- \"urtain walls were defensive walls enclosing a bailey. They had to be high enough to make scaling the walls with ladders difficult and thick enough to withstand \"\n- bombardment from siege engines which from the 15th&#160;century onwards included artillery. A typical wall could be 3&#160;m (9.8&#160;ft) wide and 12&#160;m (3\n- \"9&#160;ft) tall, although sizes varied greatly between castles. To protect them from undermining, curtain walls were sometimes given a stone skirt around their \"\n- base. Walkways along the tops of the curtain walls allowed defenders to rain missiles on enemies from above, and battlements gave them further protection. Curta\n- in walls would be studded with towers to allow enfilading fire along the wall.[24] Arrow slits in the walls did not become common in Europe until the 13th&#160;\n- |-\n century, for fear that they might compromise the wall\'s strength.[25]\n [edit] Moat\n Main article: Moat\n A moat was a defensive ditch with steep sides, and could be\n- \" either water-filled or dry. Its purpose was to stop engines such as siege towers from reaching the curtain wall and to prevent the walls from being undermined.\"\n- \" Water moats are found in low lying areas. Moats were often crossed by a drawbridge, although these were often replaced by stone bridges. The moat around Flint \"\n- \"Castle in Wales needed 1,800&#160;excavators to build. Fortified islands could be added to the moat, adding another layer of defence. Water defences, including \"\n- moats as well as natural lakes, had the benefit of dictating the enemy\'s approach to the castle.[26] The 13th-century Caerphilly Castle, also in Wales, has some\n- \" of the largest water defences in Western Europe, on a site covering over 30&#160;acres (120,000&#160;m2), created by flooding the valley to the south of the ca\"\n- |-\n stle.[27]\n [edit] Gatehouse\n Main article: Gatehouse\n An undeveloped entrance is the weakest part in a circuit of defences. To overcome this, the gatehouse was dev\n- eloped, allowing those inside the castle to control the flow of traffic. In earth and timber castles, the gateway was usually the first feature to be rebuilt in\n- \" stone. The front of the gateway was a blind spot, so to allow the defenders to see the gate without exposing themselves projecting towers were added on each si\"\n- de of the gate, in a style similar to that developed by the Romans.[28] Contained within the building would be a series of defences to make a direct assault mor\n- \"e difficult than battering down a simple gate. There would be one or more portcullis&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 a wooden grille reinforced with metal to block a passage&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 \"\n- and arrowslits to allow defenders to harry an enemy. The passage through the gatehouse would have been lengthened to increase the amount of time an assailant ha\n- \"d to spend being shot at in a confined space.[29] It is a popular myth that so-called murder-holes&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 openings in the roof of the gateway passge&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 \"\n- were used to pour boiling oil or molten lead on attackers; the price of oil and lead, and the distance of the gatehouse from fires meant that this was completel\n- y impractical. They were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, similar to machicolations or to pour water to extinguish fires.[30] Provision was made i\n- n the upper storey of the gatehouse for accommodation, so the gate was never left undefended, although this evolved to become more comfortable at the expense of\n- \" defence.[31] The entrance to a castle could be further elaborated through the addition of a barbican. This consisted of a rampart and ditch in front of the gat\"\n- ehouse.[32] Developed in the 13th and 14th centuries,[33] it could also include a tower. The purpose of a barbican was not just to provide another line of defen\n- |-\n ce but to dictate the only approach to the gate.[34]\n [edit] Other features\n Battlements were most often found surmounting curtain walls, although also on the top\n- s of gatehouses, and comprised several elements; crenellations, hoardings and machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating\n- \" crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks on top of a wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at or\"\n- \" drop objects on attackers at the base of the wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Ma\"\n- chicolations were stone openings in the top of the wall that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base off the wall in a similar fashion to hoarding\n- s.[35] Arrowslits, also commonly called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts to be fired on attack\n- ers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but the size of the opening could also impede the defender if it w\n- \"as too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming.[36]\\n\\\n [edit] History\\n\\\n [edit] Antecedents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Ambleside Roman \"\n- |-\n fort, England\n \n \n Historian Charles Coulson states that the accumulation of wealth and resources such as food in ancient societies led to the need for defensive s\n- \"tructures. The earliest fortifications originate from the Fertile Crescent, the Indus Valley, Egypt, and China where settlements were protected by large walls. \"\n- \"Northern Europe was slower than the east to develop defensive structures and it was not until the Bronze Age that hill forts were developed, which proliferated \"\n- across Europe in the Iron Age. They differed to their eastern counterparts through the use of earthworks rather than stone as a building material.[37] Many eart\n- hworks survive today, along with evidence of palisades to accompany the ditches. In Europe, oppida emerged in the 2nd&#160;century BC; they were densely inhabit\n- ed fortified settlements, such as the oppidum of Manching, and developed from hill forts.[38] The Romans encountered fortified settlements such as hill forts an\n- \"d oppida when expanding their territory into northern Europe.[38] Although primitive, they were often effective, and required extensive siege engines and other \"\n- siege warfare techniques to overcome, such as at the Battle of Alesia. The Romans\' own fortifications (castra) varied from simple temporary earthworks thrown up\n- \" by armies on the move, to elaborate permanent stone constructions, notably the milecastles of Hadrian\'s Wall. Roman forts were generally rectangular with round\"\n- \"ed corners \\xE2\\x80\\x93 a \\\"playing-card shape\\\".[39]\\n\\\n [edit] Origins and early castles\\n\\\n Like the feudal society they were part of, castles had their origins in the 9th&#160\"\n- ;and 10th&#160;centuries. This period saw the emergence of a social and military elite in the Carolingian Empire and the development of mounted fighting. Fighti\n- ng on horseback was a costly and time consuming endeavour, requiring specialised equipment and trained horses, and for their efforts these early knights were gr\n- anted land by the lords for whom they fought. The link between knight and lord was the basis of feudalism, and could go higher up the social scale with loyaltie\n- s between lords, dukes, princes, and kings. When the Carolingian Empire collapsed in the 9th&#160;and 10th&#160;centuries, it took with it effective centralised\n- \" administration,[40] and it fell to the landed elite to take over control. This led to the privatisation of government, with local lords taking on the responsib\"\n- ility for the local economy and justice. Although castles were private buildings, lordship was a public office and the holder had a responsibility to protect hi\n- s peasants.[41] There is a traditional view that feudalism was a tool of social disintegration that contributed to the downfall of the Carolingian Empire, howev\n- er modern academic opinion is that it was a successor to previous government rather than a rival.[42] Castles sometimes required the permission of the king or o\n- ther high authority. Charles the Bald prohibited the construction of castles without his permission and ordered them destroyed; this could be the earliest refer\n- ence to castles being built without permission, breaking the feudal agreement between lord and vassal, however there are very few castles dated with certainty f\n- \"rom the mid-9th&#160;century. Converted into a donjon in around 950, Dou\\xC3\\xA9-la-Fontaine, in France, is the oldest standing castle in Europe.[43]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n One of the e\"\n- \"arliest representations of a castle from the Bayeux Tapestry. It depicts attackers of Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Dinan in France using fire, one of the threats to wooden castl\"\n- \"es.\\n\\n\\n\\\n Military historian Allen Brown asserts that in the absence of a working state and the breakdown of society associated with the decline of the Carolingian \"\n- \"Empire, feudal ties became more important. The rise of castles is not solely attributed to defence of the new feudal lords\\xE2\\x80\\x99 lands, but as a reaction to attack\"\n- s by Magyars, Muslims, and Vikings.[40] It is likely that the castle evolved from the practice of fortifying a lordly home. In a time of social unrest, a lord w\n- \"ould wish to protect his home or hall, and the greatest threat was that of fire as they were usually wooden. To protect against this, and keep other threats at \"\n- \"bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it up on an \"\n- artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers.[44] While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is an\n- cient, raising a motte to exploit the advantages of height is a medieval innovation.[45] A bank and ditch enclosure was a simple form of defence, and when found\n- \" without an associated motte is called a ringwork; when the site was in use for a prolonged period, it was sometimes replaced by a more complex structure or enh\"\n- anced by the addition a stone curtain wall.[46] Building the hall in stone did not necessarily make it immune to fire as it still had windows and a wooden door.\n- \" This led to the elevation of windows to the first floor&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 to make it harder to throw objects in&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and to change the entrance from ground floor to\"\n- \" first floor. These features are seen in many surviving castle keeps, which were the more sophisticated version of halls and contained the lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s household.[4\"\n- \"7] Castles were not just used as defensive sites, but to enhance a lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s control over his lands. They allowed the garrison to control the surrounding area,[4\"\n- |-\n 8] and formed a centre of administration, providing the lord with a place to hold court.[49]\n References to castles in texts such as charters from 1000 onwards i\n- ncreased greatly. Historians have interpreted this as evidence of a sudden increase in the number of castles in Europe around this time; their interpretation ha\n- s been supported by archaeologists dating the construction of castle sites through the examination of ceramics.[50] The increase in Italy began in the 950s, wit\n- h numbers of castles increasing by a factor of three to five every 50&#160;years, whereas other parts of Europe such as France and Spain were slower. In 950, Pr\n- ovence was home to 12&#160;castles, by 1000 this figure had risen to 30, and by 1030 it was over 100.[51] Despite the common period in which castles rose to pro\n- \"minence in Europe, their form and design varied from region to region. In the early 11th&#160;century, the motte&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 an artificial mound surmounted by a pa\"\n- \"lisade and tower&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was the most common form of castle in Europe, aside from Scandinavia.[51] Castles were introduced into England shortly before the Norm\"\n- \"an Conquest in 1066.[52] The motte and bailey&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 a motte with an outer enclosure&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 remained the dominant form of castle in England, Wales, and Irel\"\n- |-\n and well into the 12th&#160;century.[53] At the same time, castle architecture in mainland Europe became more sophisticated.[54]\n \n \n \n \n Built in 1138, Castle Risin\n- \"g in England is an example of an elaborate donjon.[55]\\n\\n\\n\\\n The donjon&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 or great tower[56]&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was at the centre of this change in castle architecture\"\n- \" in the 12th&#160;century. Central towers proliferated, and typically had a square plan, with walls 3 to 4&#160;m (9.8 to 13&#160;ft) thick. Their decoration em\"\n- ulated Romanesque architecture, and sometimes incorporated double windows similar to those found in church bell towers. Donjons, which were the residence of the\n- \" lord of the castle, evolved to become more spacious. The changes in design changed from utilitarian to decorative to impose upon the landscape as a symbol of l\"\n- ordly power, sometimes compromising defence for the sake of display.[54] Historians have interpreted the widespread presence of castles across Europe in the 11t\n- |-\n h&#160;and 12th&#160;centuries as evidence that warfare was common, and usually between local lords.[57]\n In some countries, it was necessary to obtain the permi\n- ssion of the king through a licence to crenellate, or else the builder risked it being slighted. This was not universal, as in some countries, the monarch had l\n- \"ittle control over lords, or required the construction of new castles to aid in securing the land&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 as was the case in England after 1066 and the Holy La\"\n- \"nd during the Crusades&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 so was unconcerned about granting permission. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built cast\"\n- les, and as a result there are 4,000 in the country. Before the 12th&#160;century, castles were as uncommon in Denmark as they had been in England before the No\n- |-\n rman Conquest. The introduction of castles to Denmark was a reaction to attacks from Wendish pirates, and they were usually intended as coastal defences.[58]\n [e\n- \"dit] Innovation and scientific design\\n\\\n Until the 12th century, stone-built and earth and timber castles were contemporary,[59] but by the late 12th&#160;century \"\n- the number of castles being built went into decline. This has been partly attributed to the higher cost of stone-built fortifications, and the obsolescence of t\n- imber and earthwork sites, which meant it was preferable to build in more durable stone.[60] Although superseded by their stone successors, timber and earthwork\n- \" castles were by no means useless.[61] This is evidenced by the continual maintenance of timber castles over long periods, sometimes several centuries; at the s\"\n- \"tart of the 15th&#160;century Owain Glynd\\xC5\\xB5r\\xE2\\x80\\x99s castle at Sycharth, founded in the late 11th&#160;century, was a timber structure.[62][63]\\n\\\n In the late 12th&#16\"\n- 0;century, there was an obvious change in castle architecture. Until then, castles probably had few towers; a gateway with few defensive features such as arrows\n- lits or a portcullis; a great keep or donjon, usually square and without arrowslits; and the shape would have been dictated by the lay of the land, and the resu\n- lt was often irregular or curvilinear. The design of castles was of course not uniform, but these were features that could be found in a typical castle in the m\n- id-12th&#160;century.[64] By the end of the 12th&#160;century or the early 13th&#160;century, a newly constructed castle could be expected to be polygonal in sh\n- ape, with towers at the corners to provide enfilading fire for the walls. The towers would have protruded from the walls and featured arrowslits on each level t\n- o allow archers to target anyone nearing or at the curtain wall. These later castles would not always have a keep, but this may have been because the more compl\n- \"ex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers provided space for habitation to make up for the \"\n- loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to t\n- \"he castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 although there was great variety in the styles of g\"\n- \"ateway and entrances&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and one or more portcullis.[65]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The gatehouse to the inner ward of Beeston Castle, England, was built in the 1220s and has an \"\n- |-\n entrance between two half-round towers.[66]\n \n \n When seeking to explain this change in the complexity and style of castles, antiquarians found their answer in the\n- \" Crusades. It seemed logical that the Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architectu\"\n- \"re. There were legends such as that of Lalys&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 an architect from Palestine who reputedly went to Wales after the Crusades and greatly enhanced the castle\"\n- \"s in the south of the country&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and it was assumed that great architects such as James of Saint George originated in the East. However, in the mid-20th&#\"\n- 160;century this view was cast into doubt. Legends were discredited, and in the case of James of Saint George, it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d\'E\n- \"sp\\xC3\\xA9ranche, in France. If the innovations in fortification had derived from the East, it would have been expected for their influence to be seen from 1100 onwar\"\n- \"ds, immediately after the Christians were victorious in the First Crusade (1096\\xE2\\x80\\x931099), rather than nearly 100&#160;years later.[67] Roman remains in western E\"\n- urope were still upstanding in many places, and as they too featured flanking round-towers, and entrances between two flanking towers. The castle builders of we\n- stern Europe were aware of and influenced by Roman design as demonstrated by the reuse of Saxon shore forts in England, a late Roman innovation despite their na\n- \"me, and in Spain the wall around the city of Avila imitated Roman architecture when it was built in 1091.[67] It has been argued&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 by historian Smail in \"\n- \"Crusading warfare&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 that the case for the influence of eastern fortification on the west has been overstated, and that crusaders of the 12th&#160;century\"\n- \" in fact learnt very little about scientific design from Byzantine and Saracen defences.[68] The explanation for this is that a well sited castle that made use \"\n- of natural defences and had strong ditches and walls had no need for a scientific design. An example of this approach is Karak Castle. Although there were no sc\n- \"ientific elements to its design it was almost impregnable, and in 1187 Saladin chose to lay siege to the castle and starve out its garrison rather than risk an \"\n- |-\n assault.[68]\n After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did not return to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the principality of Antioch, the\n- \" County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their acquisitions were designed mostly by Syrian mas\"\n- \"ter-masons. Their design was very similar to a Roman fort or Byzantine tetrapyrgia: a square curtain wall with towers in each corner, also usually square and no\"\n- t projecting much beyond the curtain wall. In the interior, the keep would have had a square plan and generally be undecorated.[69] While castles were used to h\n- \"old a site and control movement of armies, in the Holy Land some key strategic positions were left unfortified.[70] Castle architecture in the East became more \"\n- \"complex around the late 12th and early 13th&#160;century after the stalemate of the Third Crusade (1189\\xE2\\x80\\x931192). Both Christians and Muslims created fortificati\"\n- ons, and the character of each was different. Saphadin, the 13th-century ruler of the Saracens, created structures with large rectangular towers that influenced\n- \" Muslim architecture and were copied again and again, however they had little influence on Crusader castles.[71]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Krak des Chevaliers is a concentric castle \"\n- \"built with both rectangular and rounded towers. It is amongst the best preserved Crusader castles.[72]\\n\\n\\n\\\n In the early 13th&#160;century, Crusaders castles were \"\n- mostly built by Military Orders, such as the Knights Hospitaller, Knights Templar, and Knights of the Teutonic Order. They were responsible for the foundation o\n- f sites such as Krak des Chevaliers, Margat, and Belvoir. The forms of the castle varied not just between orders, but individually from castle to castle, althou\n- gh it was common for the castles founded in this period to have concentric defences.[73] The concept, which originated in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, w\n- as to remove the reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be more than one ring of defensive wall, one i\n- nside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire was not completely obscured. If an assailant made it past the first line o\n- \"f defences into the outer enclosure, they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall to secure \"\n- \"the fall of the castle.[74] Concentric castles were widely copied across Europe, for instance when Edward I of England&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 who had himself been on Crusade&\"\n- \"#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 built castles in Wales in the late 13th&#160;century, four of the eight he founded were concentric.[73][74] Not all the features of the Crusader castle\"\n- s from the 13th &amp;nbspcentury were emulated in Europe; for instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the entrance in the side of a tower and for th\n- ere to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this feature to be found in Europe.\n- |-\n [73]\n It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels; something that contemporary builders in Europe were wary o\n- f, believing that they weakened the wall\'s structural integrity. Arrowslits did not compromise the wall\'s strength, but it was not until Edward I\'s programme of\n- \" castle building that they were adopted in Europe.[25] The Crusades also led to the introduction of machicolations into western architecture. Until the 13th&#16\"\n- 0;century, the tops of towers had been surrounded by wooden galleries, allowing defenders to drop objects on assailants below. Although machicolations performed\n- \" the same purpose as the wooden galleries, they were probably an Eastern invention rather than an evolution of the wooden form. Machicolations were used in the \"\n- |-\n East long before the arrival of the Crusades, and perhaps as early as the first half of the 8th&#160;century in Syria.[75]\n Although France has been described as\n- \" \\\"the heartland of medieval architecture\\\", the English were at the forefront of castle architecture in the 12th&#160;century. French historian Francois Gebelin \"\n- said:[76] \"The great revival in military architecture was led, as one would naturally expect, by the powerful kings and princes of the time; by the sons of Will\n- iam the Conqueror and their descendants, the Plantagenets, when they became dukes of Normandy. These were the men who built all the most typical twelfth-century\n- \" fortified castles remaining to-day\\\".[77] Despite this, by the beginning of the 15th&#160;century, the rate of castle construction in England and Wales went int\"\n- o decline; the new castles were generally of a lighter build than earlier structures and presented few innovations, although strong sites were still created suc\n- h as that of Raglan in Wales. At the same time, French castle architecture came to the fore and led the way in the field of medieval fortifications. Across Euro\n- \"pe&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 particularly the Baltic, Germany, and Scotland&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 castles were built well into the 16th&#160;century.[78]\\n\\\n [edit] Advent of gunpowder\\n\\\n Artillery\"\n- \" powered by gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns are not recorded until the 1380s and were unpredictable and inaccurate \"\n- \"weapons.[79] Castles were adapted to allow small guns&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 averaging between 19.6 and 22&#160;kg (43 and 49&#160;lb)&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 to fire from towers. These gun\"\n- s were too heavy for a man to carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle on the edge of the gun port he could fire the weapon. The g\n- \"un ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the \"\n- \"timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there \"\n- is an intact example at in Doornenburg Castle in Denmark. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on t\n- |-\n op to allow the gunner to aim.[80]\n \n \n \n \n The rounded walls of Sarzana Castle in Italy are adaptated to gunpowder.\n \n \n This form is very common in castles adapted fo\n- \"r guns, found in Egypt, Italy, Scotland, and Spain, and elsewhere in between. Other types of port, though less common were horizontal slits&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 allowing on\"\n- \"ly lateral movement&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and large square openings, which allowed greater movement.[80] The use of guns for defence gave rise to artillery castles, such as \"\n- \"that of Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Ham in France, Defences against guns was not developed until a later stage.[81] Ham is an example of the trend for new castles to dispense w\"\n- \"ith earlier features such as machicolations, tall towers, and crenellations.[82]\\n\\\n Bigger guns were developed, and in the 15th&#160;century became an alternative \"\n- \"to siege engines such as the trebuchet. The benefits of large guns over trebuchets&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the most effective siege engine of the Middle Ages before the advent\"\n- \" of gunpowder&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 were those of a greater range and greater power. In an effort to make them more effective, guns were made bigger and bigger. By the 1450s\"\n- \" guns were the preferred siege weapon, and their effectiveness was demonstrated by Mohammed II at the Siege of Constantinople.[83] The response towards more eff\"\n- ective cannons was to build thicker walls than in previous castles and to prefer round towers as the curving sides were more likely to deflect a shot than a fla\n- \"t surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures had to find a way to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled \"\n- behind a castle\'s curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.[84] Often, castles constructed before the age of gunpowder would be incapable of using gun\n- s as their wall-walks were too narrow. A solution to this was to pull down the top of a tower and to fill the lower part with the rubble to provide a surface fo\n- r the guns to fire from. Lowering the defences in this way had the effect of making them easier to scale with ladders. A more popular alternative defence, which\n- \" avoided damaging the castle, was to establish bulwarks beyond the castle\'s defences. These could be built from earthier earth or stone and were used to mount w\"\n- |-\n eapons.[85]\n Around 1500, the innovation of the angled bastion over curved was developed in Italy.[86] The elite who were responsible for castle construction wer\n- e forced to choose between the new type which could withstand cannon-fire but as a result was ugly and uncomfortable to live in, or to stick with an earlier mor\n- e elaborate style with had more aesthetic appeal and was more of a status symbol. The second choice was more popular, and while the castle retained its use as a\n- \" status symbol, it became apparent that earlier fortifications were unable to stand up to cannons, and so there was no point in trying to make the site genuinel\"\n- |-\n y defensible.[87]\n \n \n \n \n Fortaleza Ozama in the Dominican Republic was the first castle built in the Americas\n \n \n However, some true castles were built in the Americ\n- \"as by the Spanish, English, and French colonies. The first stage of Spanish fort construction has been termed the \\\"castle period\\\", which lasted from 1492 until \"\n- the end of the 16th&#160;century.[88] Starting with Fortaleza Ozama, \"these castles were essentially European medieval castles transposed to America.\"[89] Among\n- \" other defensive structures (including forts and citadels), castles were also built in New France towards the end of the 17th&#160;century.[89] Where artillery \"\n- \"was not as developed as on the battle-fields of Europe, some of Montreal\'s outlying forts were built like the fortified manor houses of France. Fort Longueuil, \"\n- \"built from 1695\\xE2\\x80\\x931698 by a baronial family, has been described as \\\"the most medieval-looking fort built in Canada\\\".[90] The manor house and stables were within\"\n- \" a fortified bailey, with a tall round turret in each corner. The \\\"most substantial castle-like fort\\\" near Montr\\xC3\\xA9al was Fort Senneville, built in 1692 with squ\"\n- are towers connected by thick stone walls, as well as a fortified windmill.[91] Stone forts such as these served as defensive residences, as well as imposing st\n- |-\n ructures to prevent Iroquois incursions.[92]\n Although castle construction faded towards the 16th&#160;century, they did not necessarily all fall out of use. Som\n- e retained some role in local administration and became law courts, while others are still handed down in aristocratic families as hereditary seats. A particula\n- rly famous example of this is Windsor Castle in England which was founded in the 11th&#160;century and is home to the monarch of the United Kingdom.[93] In othe\n- r cases they still had a role in defence. Tower houses, which are closely related to castles and include pele towers, were defended towers that were permanent r\n- esidences built in the 14th to 17th centuries. Especially common in Ireland and Scotland, they could be up to five storeys high and succeeded common enclosure c\n- \"astles and were built by a greater social range of people. While unlikely to provide as much protection as a more complex castle, they offered security against \"\n- |-\n raiders and other small threats.[94][95]\n [edit] Later use and revival castles\n According to archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham, \"the great country\n- \" houses of the seventeenth to twentieth centuries were, in a social sense, the castles of their day\\\".[96] Although there was a trend for the elite to move from \"\n- \"castles into country houses in the 17th&#160;century, castles were not completely useless. In later conflicts, such as the English Civil War (1641\\xE2\\x80\\x931651), many\"\n- \" castles were refortified, although subsequently slighted to prevent them from being used again.[97]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Neuschwanstein is a 19th-century neo-romantic castle bu\"\n- |-\n ilt by Ludwig II of Bavaria.\n \n \n Artificial ruins became popular in the 18th&#160;century as a manifestation of a romantic interest in the Middle Ages and chivalr\n- y, and as part of the broader Gothic Revival in architecture. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar,\n- \" although differed from artificial ruins in that they were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on el\"\n- ements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but they served no military purpose and were solely for display.[98] Revival or mock castles, mos\n- t of which were country houses, were particularly common in the British Isles, for example Belvoir Castle and Eastnor Castle in England and Castell Coch in Wale\n- \"s.[99] Edwin Lutyens\' Castle Drogo (1911\\xE2\\x80\\x931930) was the last flicker of this movement in England.[100] In Mexico, Chapultepec Castle, a former military strongh\"\n- old, used as the imperial residence of the monarchs of the Second Mexican Empire, was created in the Neo-Classical and Neo-Gothic styles.[101] Also, the 19th-ce\n- |-\n ntury Neuschwanstein is one such revival castle in Germany.[102]\n [edit] Construction\n See also: Medieval technology&#160;and Stonemasonry\n \n \n \n \n Construction of a l\n- |-\n arge tower, with scaffolding and masons at work. The holes mark the position of the scaffolding in earlier stages of construction.\n \n \n Once the site of a castle h\n- \"ad been selected&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 whether a strategic position or one intended to dominate the landscape as a mark of power&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the building material had to be sel\"\n- \"ected. An earth and timber castle was cheaper and easier to erect than one built from stone. The costs involved in construction are not well recorded, and most \"\n- surviving records relate to royal castles.[103] A castle with earthen ramparts, a motte, and timber defences and buildings could have been constructed by an uns\n- killed workforce. The source of man-power was probably from the local lordship, and the tenants would already have the necessary skills of felling trees, diggin\n- g, and working timber necessary for an earth and timber castle. Possibly coerced into working for their lord, the construction of an earth and timber castle wou\n- \"ld not have been a drain on a client\\xE2\\x80\\x99s funds. In terms of time, it has been estimated that an average sized motte&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 5&#160;m (16&#160;ft) high and 15&#\"\n- \"160;m (49&#160;ft) wide at the summit&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 would have taken 50&#160;people about 40&#160;working days. An exceptionally expensive motte and bailey was that \"\n- \"of Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 for \\xC2\\xA320. The high cost, relative to other castles of its type, was because labourers had to be imported.[103]\\n\\\n Although thei\"\n- r cost varied according to factors such as their complexity and transport costs for material, it is certain that stone castles cost a great deal more than those\n- \" built from earth and timber. Even a very small tower, such as Peveril Castle, would have cost around \\xC2\\xA3200. In the middle were castles such as Orford, which wa\"\n- \"s built in the late 12th&#160;century for \\xC2\\xA31,400, and at the upper end were those such as Dover, which cost about \\xC2\\xA37,000 between 1112 and 1191.[104] Spending \"\n- \"on the scale of the vast castles such as Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau Gaillard (an estimated \\xC2\\xA315,000 to \\xC2\\xA320,000 between 1196 and 1198) was easily supported by The Crown, but for \"\n- \"lords of smaller areas, castle building was a very serious and costly undertaking. It was usual for a stone castle to take the best part of a decade to finish. \"\n- \"The cost of a large castle built over this time (anywhere from \\xC2\\xA31,000 to \\xC2\\xA310,000) would take the income from several manors, severely impacting on a lord\\xE2\\x80\\x99s \"\n- \"finances.[105] Cost in the late 13th&#160;century were of a similar order, with castles such as Beaumaris and Rhuddlan costing \\xC2\\xA314,500 and \\xC2\\xA39,000 respectively\"\n- \". Edward I\\xE2\\x80\\x99s campaign of castle-building in Wales cost \\xC2\\xA380,000 between 1277 and 1304, and \\xC2\\xA395,000 between 1277 and 1329.[106] Renowned designer Master James\"\n- \" of Saint George, responsible for the construction of Beaumaris, explained the cost:\\n\\n\\\n In case you should wonder where so much money could go in a week, we would\"\n- \" have you know that we have needed&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 and shall continue to need 400 masons, both cutters and layers, together with 2,000 less skilled workmen, 100&#160;c\"\n- arts, 60&#160;wagons and 30&#160;boats bringing stone and sea coal; 200&#160;quarrymen; 30&#160;smiths; and carpenters for putting in the joists and floor board\n- s and other necessary jobs. All this takes no account of the garrison&#160;... nor of purchases of material. Of which there will have to be a great quantity&#16\n- \"0;... The men\\xE2\\x80\\x99s pay has been and still is very much in arrears, and we are having the greatest difficulty in keeping them because they have simply nothing to \"\n- |-\n live on.[107]\n \n Not only were stone castles expensive to build in the first place, but their maintenance was a constant drain. They contained a lot of timber, wh\n- \"ich was often unseasoned and as a result needed careful upkeep. Castles such as Exeter and Gloucester were often given figures of between \\xC2\\xA320 and \\xC2\\xA350 annually\"\n- \" in the late 12th&#160;century for constant repairs.[108]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The Castle of the Teutonic Order in Malbork, Poland, is an example of brick-built castle and was b\"\n- \"uilt in a style different to that of castles in western Europe and the Near East.[109]\\n\\n\\n\\\n Medieval machines and inventions, such as the treadwheel crane, became \"\n- indispensable during construction, and techniques of building wooden scaffolding were improved upon from Antiquity.[110] Finding stone for shell keeps and castl\n- \"e walls was the first concern of medieval builders, and a major preoccupation was to have quarries close at hand.[111] There are examples of some castles where \"\n- \"stone was quarried on site, such as Chinon, Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau de Coucy and Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau Gaillard.[111]\\n\\\n Brick-built structures were not necessarily weaker than their stone-bu\"\n- ilt counterparts. In England, brick production proliferated along the south-east coast due to an influx of Flemish weavers and a reduction in the amount of avai\n- lable, leading to a demand for an alternative building material. Brick castles are less common than stone or earth and timber constructions, and often it was ch\n- \"osen for its aesthetic appeal or because it was in fashion, encouraged by the brick architecture of the Low Countries. For example, when Tattershall Castle was \"\n- built between 1430 and 1450, there was plenty of stone available nearby, however the owner, Lord Cromwell, chose to use brick. About 700,000 bricks were used to\n- \" built the castle, which has been described as \\xE2\\x80\\x9Cthe finest piece of medieval brick-work in England\\xE2\\x80\\x9D.[112] Brick castles were predominant in Scandinavia and \"\n- |-\n the Baltic;[113] Denmark had few quarries, and as a result, most of its castles are earth and timber affairs, or later on built from brick.[114]\n [edit] Social c\n- |\n entre\n Main article: Court (royal)\n \n \n \n \n God Speed! by Edmund Blair Leighton, 1900: a late Victorian view of a lady giving a favour to a knight about to do battle\n\n- \"\\n\\n\\\n Due to the lord\'s presence in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as \"\n- \"without the support of his more powerful tennants, a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately \"\n- below them on the social scale, but absentee lords found their power weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit a\n- ll his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.[115] To allow the l\n- ord to concentrate on his duties regarding administration, he had a household of servants to take care of chores such as providing food. The household was run b\n- y a chamberlain, while a treasurer took care of the estate\'s written records. Royal households took essentially the same form as baronial households, although o\n- n a much larger scale and the positions were more prestigious.[116] Without the presence of a lord\'s household, usually because he was staying elsewhere, a cast\n- le would have been a quiet place with few residents, focused on maintaining the castle.[117] Not just a utilitarian structure, as social centres castles were al\n- \"so important places for display. Builders took the opportunity to draw on symbolism to evoke a sense of chivalry that was aspired to in the Middle Ages amongst \"\n- \"the elite. Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features.[118] The \"\n- \"right to crenelate, when granted by a monarch&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 though it was not always necessary&amp;bsp;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 was important not just as it allowed a lord to defend his \"\n- \"property but because crenelations and other accoutrements associated with castles were prestigious through their use by the elite.[119]\\n\\\n The purpose of marriage \"\n- \"between the medieval elites was to secure land, not for love; girls were married in their teens, but boys did not marry until they came of age.[120] There is a \"\n- popular conception that women played a peripheral role in the medieval castle household, and that it was dominated by the lord himself. This derives from the im\n- age of the castle as a martial institution, but most castles in England, France, Ireland, and Scotland were never involved in conflicts or sieges, so the domest\n- \"ic life is a neglected facet.[121] The lady was given a \\\"marriage portion\\\" of her husband\'s estates&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 usually about a third&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 which were hers for \"\n- life, and her husband would inherit on her death; it was her duty to administer them directly, as the lord administered his own land.[122] Despite generally bei\n- ng excluded from military service, a woman could be in charge of a castle, either on behalf of her lordly husband or if she was widowed. Because of their influe\n- nce within the medieval household women influenced construction and design, sometimes through direct patronage; historian Charles Coulson emphasises the role of\n- \" women in applying \\\"a refined aristocratic taste\\\" to castles due to their long term residence.[123] Courtly love was the eroticisation of love between the nobil\"\n- \"ity. Emphasis was placed on restraint between lovers. It was sometimes in private and was expressed through chivalric events such as tournaments. The legend of \"\n- Tristan and Iseult is one example of stories of courtly love told in the Middle Ages.[124] It was an ideal of love between two people not married to each other,\n- \" although the man might be married to someone else. It was not uncommon or ignoble for a lord to be adulterous&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 Henry I of England had over 20&#160;bast\"\n- \"ards for instance&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 but for a lady to be promiscuous was seen as dishonourable.[125]\\n\\\n [edit] Castle landscapes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n The approach to Kenilworth Castle, Engl\"\n- |-\n and, was lengthened to form a winding route through a moat and an artificial water landscape.\n \n \n As castles were not simply military buildings but centres of adm\n- inistration and symbols of power, they had a significant impact on the landscape around them. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems d\n- \"ue to their role in managing the lord\'s estate,[126] which gave them greater influence over resources.[127] Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer \"\n- parks and were important in their maintenance. Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, and many were found next to castles. Not only were they practical i\n- |-\n n that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.[128]\n Although sometimes the const\n- \"ruction of a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it is more common for the villages nearby to have grown as a result \"\n- of the presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle.[126] The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confi\n- ned to Europe; when Safad Castle was founded in Galilee, in the Holy Land, during the 13th&#160;century, the nearby town benefited from its presence as people c\n- ould now move freely in the area and the 260&#160;villages locally became profitable.[129] When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local l\n- andscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord.[130] Settlements grew naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of p\n- roximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importa\n- \"nce&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement dep\"\n- |-\n opulated.[131]\n During and shortly after the Norman Conquest of England, castles were inserted into important pre-existing towns to control and subdue the popula\n- ce. They were usually location with reference to any existing town defences, such as Roman walls, although this sometimes resulted in the demolition of structur\n- es occupying the desired site. In Lincoln, 166&#160;houses were destroyed to clear space for the castle, and in York agricultural land was flooded to create a m\n- oat for the castle. As the military importance of urban castles waned from their early origins, they became more important as centres of administration, and the\n- ir financial and judicial roles.[132] When the Normans invaded Ireland, Scotland, and Wales in the 11th&#160;and 12th&#160;centuries, settlement in those countr\n- |-\n ies was predominantly non-urban, and the foundation of towns is often linked with the creation of a castle.[133]\n Symbolism in relation to castles and their sett\n- ing was very important, as demonstrated by the proximity of high status features such as fish ponds. Also often found near to a castle, sometimes within its def\n- ences, was the parish church.[134] This has been interpreted as a relationship between the church and feudal lords, where the lords patronised the church, which\n- \" was one of the most important institutions of medieval society.[135] Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military can be\"\n- \" highly symbolic. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 comprising a moat and several satellite ponds&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 forced anyone approaching t\"\n- he castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway.[136] Another example is that of the\n- \" 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advance castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and t\"\n- he moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site look more impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer a\n- round the castle, ensuring they got a good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.[137] This also dem\n- onstrates that licenses to crenellate were not solely about a desire to defend oneself, but to have proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who\n- \" was the one responsible for granting permission.[138]\\n\\\n [edit] Warfare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n A trebuchet at Ch\\xC3\\xA2teau des Baux in France\\n\\n\\n\\\n As a static structure, castles could ofte\"\n- n be avoided as their immediate area of influence was about 400&#160;metres (1,300&#160;ft) and their weapons had a short range even early in the age of artille\n- ry. Although leaving an enemy behind the army would allow them to interfere with communications and make raids in the landscape to harry the army. Garrisons wer\n- e expensive, and as a result often small unless the castle was important.[139] Garrisons were smaller in peace time due to the cost of upkeep, and small castles\n- \" were manned by perhaps a couple of watchmen and gate-guards. Even in war garrisons were not necessarily large as too large a defending force would impair the c\"\n- \"astles ability to withstand a long siege; in 1403 a force of 37&#160;archers successfully defended Caernarfon Castle against two assaults by Owain Glynd\\xC5\\xB5r\'s al\"\n- lies during a long siege.[140] Early on, manning a castle was a feudal duty of vassals to their magnates, and magnates to their kings, however this was later re\n- \"placed with paid forces.[140][141] If it was necessary to control the castle for strategic reasons, an army could lay siege to it and starve the defenders out. \"\n- \"Without relief from an outside source, the defending army would eventually submit, but sieges could last weeks, months, and in rare cases years if the supplies \"\n- of food and water were plentiful. A long siege could slow down the army, allowing help to come or for the enemy to prepare a larger force for later.[142] For th\n- e most heavily fortified sites it was more efficient to starve the garrison out that to assault it. Such an approach was not confined to castles, but was also a\n- \"pplied to the fortified towns of the day.[143] On occasion, siege castles would be built to defend the besiegers from a sudden sally.[144]\\n\\\n If forced to assault \"\n- \"a castle, there were many options available to the attackers. For wooden structures, such as early motte-and-baileys, fire was a real threat and attempts would \"\n- \"be made to set them on fire.[143] Project weapons had been used since antiquity and the mangonel and petraria&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 from Roman and Oriental origins respectiv\"\n- \"ely&#160;\\xE2\\x80\\x93 were the main two that were used into the Middle Ages. The trebuchet, probably evolved from the petraria in the 13th&#160;century, was the most eff\"\n- \"ective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. \"\n- Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high trajectory of its projectile, and would be protected from direct fi\n- re by the curtain walls.[145] Eventually cannons developed to the point where they were more powerful and had a greater range than the trebuchet, and became the\n- \" main weapon in siege warfare.[83] Walls could be undermined by the creation of a sap; a mine would be dug to conceal the attackers approach to the wall, with w\"\n- ooden supports to prevent the tunnel from collapsing. When the target had been reached, the supports would be burned, caving in the tunnel and bringing down the\n- \" structure above.[146] Battering rams were also used, usually in the form of a tree trunk given an iron cap. They were used to batter down the castle gates, alt\"\n- \"hough they were sometimes used against walls, but with less effect.[147] As an alternative to creating a breach in the walls, an escalade could be attempted to \"\n- capture the walls, with fighting along the walkways on the curtain walls;[148] in this instance, attackers would be very vulnerable to arrowfire, particularly f\n- \"rom crossbows or the English longbow.[149]\\n\\\n [edit] See also\\n\\n\\\n Alc\\xC3\\xA1zar (Spanish castles)\\n\\\n Shiro (Japanese fortifications)\\n\\n\\\n [edit] References\\n\\n\\\n Notes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2\"\n- |\n 005, pp.&#160;7, 10.\n ^ Creighton &amp; Higham 2003, p.&#160;6.\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;32.\n ^ Allen Brown 2004, p.&#160;1.\n ^ a b Coulson 2003, p.&#160;16.\n\n- \"^ Liddiard 2005, pp.&#160;15\\xE2\\x80\\x9317.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;47.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, p.&#160;18.\\n\\\n ^ Stephens 1969, pp.&#160;452\\xE2\\x80\\x93475.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, pp.&#160;2, 6\\xE2\\x80\\x93\"\n- \"7.\\n\\\n ^ Creighton &amp; Higham 2003, pp.&#160;6\\xE2\\x80\\x937.\\n\\\n ^ Liddiard 2005, p.&#160;2.\\n\\\n ^ a b Friar 2003, p.&#160;214.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;55.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Bar\"\n- \"th\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 397\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;22.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, pp.&#160;214, 216.\\n\\\n ^ Friar 2003, p.&#160;105.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Barth\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 399\\n\\\n ^\"\n- \" Friar 2003, p.&#160;163.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;188.\\n\\\n ^ Cathcart King 1988, p.&#160;190.\\n\\\n ^ Duby (ed.); Barth\\xC3\\xA9lemy, Dominique, p. 402-6.

Typicall\n- |-\n y, costs are borne in the majority by government-funded programs.\n Universal health care systems vary according to the extent of government involvement in provid\n- ing care and/or health insurance. In some countries, such as the UK, Spain, and the Nordic countries, the government has a high degree of involvement in the com\n- missioning or delivery of health care services and access is based on residence rights not on the purchase of insurance. Others have a much more pluralistic del\n- ivery system based on obligatory health with contributory insurance rates related to salaries or income, and usually funded by employers and beneficiaries joint\n- ly. Sometimes the health funds are derived from a mixture of insurance premiums and government taxes. These insurance based systems tend to have a higher propor\n- \"tion of private medical providers obtaining reimbursement, often at heavily regulated rates, through mutual or publicly owned medical insurers. A few countries \"\n- such as the Netherlands and Switzerland operate via privately owned but heavily regulated private insurers. Americans use the term \"single-payer health care\" to\n- \" describe the pooling of health care funds into a single not-for-profit fund for a region or nation.

In Britain, the National Insurance Act 1911 marked the first steps there towards universal health care, coverin\n- g most employed persons and their financial dependents and all persons who had been continuous contributors to the scheme for at least five years whether they w\n- ere working or not. This system of health insurance continued in force until the creation of the National Health Service in 1948 which extended health care secu\n- rity to all legal residents. Most current universal health care systems were implemented in the period following the Second World War as a process of deliberate\n- \" healthcare reform, intended to make health care available to all, in the spirit of Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, signed by e\"\n- |-\n very country doing so. The US did not ratify the social and economic rights sections, including Article 25\'s right to health.[2]\n [edit] Implementation and Compa\n- |-\n risons\n See also: Health care system\n Universal health care is a broad concept that has been implemented in several ways. The common denominator for all such prog\n- rams is some form of government action aimed at extending access to health care as widely as possible and setting minimum standards. Most implement universal he\n- alth care through legislation, regulation and taxation. Legislation and regulation direct what care must be provided, to whom, and on what basis. Usually some c\n- osts are borne by the patient at the time of consumption but the bulk of costs come from a combination of compulsory insurance and tax revenues. Some programs a\n- re paid for entirely out of tax revenues. In others tax revenues are used either to fund insurance for the very poor or for those needing long term chronic care\n- \". The UK government\'s National Audit Office in 2003 published an international comparison of ten different health care systems in ten developed countries, nine \"\n- universal systems against one non-universal system (the U.S.), and their relative costs and key health outcomes.[3] A wider international comparison of 16 count\n- ries, each with universal health care, was published by the World Health Organization in 2004 [4] In some cases, government involvement also includes directly m\n- |-\n anaging the health care system, but many countries use mixed public-private systems to deliver universal health care.\n [edit] Americas\n Argentina, Brazil (see bel\n- ow), Canada (see below), Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico (see below), Panama, Peru (see below), Uruguay, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela all have public unive\n- |-\n rsal health care provided.\n [edit] Brazil\n Main article: Health care in Brazil\n The universal health care system was adopted in Brazil in 1988 after the end of the\n- \" military regime\'s rule.\\n\\\n [edit] Canada\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in Canada\\n\\\n In 1984, the Canada Health Act was passed, which prohibited extra billing by doctors \"\n- on patients while at the same time billing the public insurance system. In 1999, the prime minister and most premiers reaffirmed in the Social Union Framework A\n- \"greement that they are committed to health care that has \\\"comprehensiveness, universality, portability, public administration and accessibility.\\\"[5]\\n\\\n The system \"\n- \"is for the most part publicly funded, yet most of the services are provided by private enterprises or private corporations, although most hospitals are public. \"\n- Most doctors do not receive an annual salary, but receive a fee per visit or service.[6] About 29% of Canadians\' health care is paid for by the private sector o\n- \"r individuals.[7] This mostly goes towards services not covered or only partially covered by Medicare such as prescription drugs, dentistry and vision care.[8] \"\n- \"Many Canadians have private health insurance, often through their employers, that cover these expenses.[9]\\n\\\n The Canada Health Act of 1984 \\\"does not directly bar \"\n- private delivery or private insurance for publicly insured services,\" but provides financial disincentives for doing so. \"Although there are laws prohibiting or\n- \" curtailing private health care in some provinces, they can be changed,\\\" according to a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.[10][11] The legality of t\"\n- he ban was considered in a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada which ruled in Chaoulli v. Quebec that \"the prohibition on obtaining private health insurance\n- \", while it might be constitutional in circumstances where health care services are reasonable as to both quality and timeliness, is not constitutional where the\"\n- \" public system fails to deliver reasonable services.\\\" The appellant contended that waiting times in Quebec violated a right to life and security in the Quebec C\"\n- harter of Human Rights and Freedoms. The Court agreed, but acknowledged the importance and validity of the Canada Health Act, and at least four of the seven jud\n- \"ges explicitly recognized the right of governments to enact laws and policies which favour the public over the private system and preserve the integrity of the \"\n- |-\n public system.\n [edit] Colombia\n Main article: Health in Colombia\n In 1993 a reform transformed the health care system in Colombia, trying to provide a better, sus\n- |-\n tainable, health care system and to reach every Colombian citizen.\n [edit] Mexico\n Further information: Health care in Mexico\n On December 1, 2006 the Mexican gove\n- \"rnment created the Health Insurance for a New Generation also known as \\\"life insurance for babies\\\".[12][13][14]\\n\\\n On May 28, 2009 Mexico announced Universal Care \"\n- |-\n Coverage for Pregnant Women.[15]\n [edit] Peru\n On April 9, 2009 the Government of Peru published the Law on Health Insurance to enable all Peruvians to access qua\n- lity health services, and contribute to regulate the financing and supervision of these services.

According to the Institute of Medicine of the National A\n- \"cademies of Science, this unfunded \\xE2\\x80\\x9Csafety net\\xE2\\x80\\x9D mandate has contributed to increasing strain on the health system. Emergency treatment is not free or subsid\"\n- ized and some patients cannot or will not pay their bills. Furthermore, this system encourages use of the emergency facilities for primary care and not just for\n- \" emergency purposes.[18]\\n\\\n In lieu of a national program, some states and municipalities have made attempts to approach universality of insurance in their respect\"\n- ive jurisdictions. The state of Massachusetts implemented a near-universal health care system by mandating that residents purchase health insurance by July 1, 2\n- 007.[19] The City of San Francisco is also undertaking a universal health care system for uninsured residents.[20][21] Hawaii has, since 1974, required employer\n- s to provide employees working more than 20 hours per week with a comprehensive health insurance plan.[22] California, Maine and Vermont are also considering or\n- \" seeking to implement universal or near-universal systems.[23] In July, 2009, Connecticut passed into law a plan called SustiNet, with the goal of achieving nea\"\n- |-\n r-universal healthcare coverage by 2014.[24]\n Whether a federal system of universal health care should be implemented in the US remains a hotly debated political\n- \" topic, with Americans divided in their views.\\n\\\n [edit] Asia\\n\\\n Bhutan, Brunei, China,[25] Hong Kong SAR, India[citation needed], Kuwait[citation needed], Qatar[cita\"\n- tion needed], UAE[citation needed], Saudi Arabia[citation needed], Israel,[26] Japan, Malaysia[citation needed], South Korea, Seychelles[citation needed], Sri L\n- |-\n anka,[27] Taiwan,[28], Pakistan[citation needed] and Thailand[citation needed] have universal health care.\n [edit] Bhutan\n Main article: Health in Bhutan\n The Roya\n- \"l Government of Bhutan maintains a policy of free and universal access to primary health care. As hospital facilities in the country are limited, patients with \"\n- diseases that cannot be treated in Bhutan, such as cancer, are normally referred to hospitals in India for treatment. Such referral treatment is also carried ou\n- \"t at the cost of the Royal Government.[29]\\n\\\n [edit] People\'s Republic of China\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare system reform in the People\'s Republic of China\\n\\\n Since the \"\n- \"founding of the People\'s Republic of China, the goal of health care programs has been to provide care to every member of the population and to make maximum use \"\n- |-\n of limited health-care personnel, equipment, and financial resources.[citation needed]\n China is undertaking a reform on its health care system, which was largel\n- y privatized in the 1990s. The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS), is a new 2005 initiative to overhaul the healthcare system, particularly int\n- ended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, the annual cost of medical cover is 50 yuan (US$7) per person. Of that, 20 yuan is paid i\n- \"n by the central government, 20 yuan by the provincial government and a contribution of 10 yuan is made by the patient. As of September 2007, around 80% of the \"\n- whole rural population of China had signed up (about 685 million people). The system is tiered, depending on the location. If patients go to a small hospital or\n- \" clinic in their local town, the scheme will cover from 70-80% of their bill. If they go to a county one, the percentage of the cost being covered falls to abou\"\n- \"t 60%. And if they need specialist help in a large modern city hospital, they have to bear most of the cost themselves, the scheme would cover about 30% of the \"\n- \"bill.[30]\\n\\\n On January 21, 2009, the Chinese government announced that a total of 850 billion yuan will be provided between 2009 and 2011 in order to improve the \"\n- \"existing health care system.[31]\\n\\\n [edit] Hong Kong SAR\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in Hong Kong\\n\\\n Hong Kong is one of the healthiest places in the world.[32] Because \"\n- of its early health education, professional health services, and well-developed health care and medication system, Hongkongers enjoy a life expectancy of 84 for\n- \" females and 78 for males,[33] which is the second highest in the world, and 2.94 infant mortality rate, the fourth lowest in the world.[34][35]\\n\\\n There are two m\"\n- \"edical schools in Hong Kong, and several schools offering courses in traditional Chinese medicine. The Hospital Authority is a statutory body that operates and \"\n- \"manages all public hospitals. Hong Kong has high standards of medical practice. It has contributed to the development of liver transplantation, being the first \"\n- |-\n in the world to carry out adult to adult live donor liver transplant in 1993.[36]\n [edit] India\n Main article: Healthcare in India\n India has a universal health ca\n- re system run by the local (state or territorial), governments. The government hospitals, some of which are among the best hospitals in India,[37] provide treat\n- |-\n ment at taxpayer expense. Most essential drugs are offered free of charge in these hospitals.\n Government hospitals provide treatment either free or at minimal c\n- harges. For example, an outpatient card at AIIMS (one of the best hospitals in India) costs a one time fee of rupees 10 (Around 20 cents US) and thereafter outp\n- atient medical advice is free. In-hospital treatment costs depend on financial condition of the patient and facilities utilized by him but are usually much less\n- \" than the private sector. For instance, a patient is waived treatment costs if he is below poverty line. Another patient may seek for an air-conditioned room if\"\n- \" he is willing to pay extra for it. The charges for basic in-hospital treatment and investigations are much less compared to the private sector. The cost for th\"\n- |-\n ese subsidies comes from annual allocations from the central and state governments.\n Primary health care is provided by city and district hospitals and rural pri\n- mary health centres (PHCs). These hospitals provide treatment free of cost. Primary care is focused on immunization, prevention of malnutrition, pregnancy, chil\n- d birth, postnatal care, and treatment of common illnesses.[citation needed] Patients who receive specialized care or have complicated illnesses are referred to\n- \" secondary (often located in district and taluk headquarters) and tertiary care hospitals (located in district and state headquarters or those that are teaching\"\n- \" hospitals).[citation needed] However, the fact that the government sector is understaffed and underfinanced and poor services at state run hospitals forces man\"\n- |-\n y people to visit private medical practitioners.\n Now organizations like Hindustan Latex Family Planning Promotional Trust and other private organizations have s\n- |-\n tarted creating hospitals and clinics in India, which also provide free or subsidized health care and subsidized insurance plans.[citation needed]\n [edit] Israel\n- |-\n \n Main article: Health care in Israel\n \n \n \n \n \n This section does not cite any references or sources.

(October 2009)\\n\\n\\n\\\n In Israel, the National Health Insurance Law (or National Health Insurance Act) is \"\n- the legal framework which enables and facilitates basic, compulsory universal health care. The Law was put into effect by the Knesset on January 1, 1995, and wa\n- s based on recommendations put forward by a National Committee of Inquiry which examined restructuring the health care system in Israel in the late 1980s. Prior\n- \" to the law\'s passage approximately 85% of the population was already covered by voluntarily belonging to one of four nation-wide, not-for-profit health mainten\"\n- ance organizations (HMOs/sick funds). However, there were three problems associated with this arrangement. First, membership in the largest HMO, Clalit, require\n- \"d one to belong to the Histadrut labor organization, even if a person did not wish to (or could not) have such an affiliation while other HMOs restricted entry \"\n- to new members based on age, pre-existing conditions or other factors. Second, different HMOs provided different levels of benefit coverage or services to their\n- \" members and lastly was the issue mentioned above whereby a certain percentage of the population, albeit a small one, did not have health insurance coverage at \"\n- |-\n all.\n \n \n \n \n \n This section may stray from the topic of the article&#160;into the topic of another article, Health care in Israel. Please help improve this section o\n- |-\n r discuss this issue on the talk page.\n \n \n Before the law went into effect, all the HMOs collected premiums directly from members. However, upon passage of the la\n- w, a new progressive national health insurance tax was levied through Israel\'s social security agency which then re-distributes the proceeds to the HMOs based o\n- n their membership and its demographic makeup. This ensured that all citizens would now have health coverage. While membership in one of the HMOs now became com\n- pulsory for all, free choice was introduced into movement of members between HMOs (a change is allowed once per year), effectively making the various HMOs compe\n- te equally for members among the populace. Annually, a committee appointed by the ministry of health publishes a \"basket\" or uniform package of medical services\n- \" and prescription formulary which all HMOs must provide as a minimum service to all their members. Achieving this level of equality ensured that all citizens ar\"\n- e guaranteed to receive basic healthcare regardless of their HMO affiliation which was one of the principal aims of the law. An appeals process was put in place\n- \" to handle rejection of treatments and procedures by the HMOs and evaluating cases falling outside the \\\"basket\\\" of services or prescription formulary.\\n\\\n While the\"\n- \" law is generally considered a success and Israeli citizens enjoy a high standard of medical care comparatively, with more competition having been introduced in\"\n- \"to the field of health care in the country, and order having been brought into what was once a somewhat disorganized system, the law nevertheless does have its \"\n- critics. First and foremost among the criticisms raised is that the \"basket\" may not provide enough coverage. To partly address this issue, the HMOs and insuran\n- \"ce companies (often in conjunction with employers) began offering additional \\\"supplementary\\\" insurance to cover certain additional services not included in the \"\n- \"basket. However, since this insurance is optional, critics argue that it goes against the spirit of the new law which stressed equality among all citizens with \"\n- respect to healthcare. Another criticism is that in order to provide universal coverage to all, the tax income base amount (the maximum amount of yearly earning\n- s that are subject to the tax) was set rather high, causing many high-income taxpayers to see the amount they pay for their health premiums (now health tax) sky\n- |-\n rocket. Finally, some complain about the constantly rising costs of copayments for certain services.\n [edit] Singapore\n Main article: Health care in Singapore\n Sin\n- gapore has a universal health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through compulsory savings and price controls, while the private secto\n- r provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources.[38] Singapore currently has the\n- \" lowest infant mortality rate in the world (equaled only by Iceland) and among the highest life expectancies from birth, according to the World Health Organizat\"\n- ion.[39] Singapore has \"one of the most successful healthcare systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in communi\n- ty health outcomes,\" according to an analysis by global consulting firm Watson Wyatt.[40] Singapore\'s system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payro\n- \"ll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as \\\"actively regulating the supply \"\n- and prices of healthcare services in the country\" to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a \"very difficult system to r\n- eplicate in many other countries.\" Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by t\n- \"he government\'s programs.[40]\\n\\\n [edit] Taiwan (Republic of China)\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in Taiwan\\n\\\n The current health care system in Taiwan, known as National \"\n- Health Insurance (NHI), was instituted in 1995. NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars\n- . The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.[41] NHI is mainly financed t\n- hrough premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-fo\n- |-\n r-service predominated for both public and private providers.\n NHI delivers universal coverage offered by a government-run insurer. The working population pays p\n- \"remiums split with their employers, others pay a flat rate with government help and the poor or veterans are fully subsidized. Taiwan\\xE2\\x80\\x99s citizens no longer hav\"\n- |-\n e to worry about going bankrupt due to medical bills.[42]\n Under this model, citizens have free range to choose hospitals and physicians without using a gatekeep\n- \"er and do not have to worry about waiting lists. NHI offers a comprehensive benefit package that covers preventive medical services, prescription drugs, dental \"\n- \"services, Chinese medicine, home nurse visits and many more. Working people do not have to worry about losing their jobs or changing jobs because they will not \"\n- lose their insurance. Since NHI, the previously uninsured have increased their usage of medical services. Most preventive services are free such as annual check\n- \"ups and maternal and child care. Regular office visits have co-payments as low as US $5 per visit. Co-payments are fixed and unvaried by the person\\xE2\\x80\\x99s income.[\"\n- |-\n 43]\n [edit] Thailand\n Main article: Health care in Thailand\n Thailand introduced universal coverage reforms in 2001, becoming one of only a handful of lower-middle\n- \" income countries to do so. Means-tested health care for low income households was replaced by a new and more comprehensive insurance scheme, originally known a\"\n- s the 30 baht project, in line with the small co-payment charged for treatment. People joining the scheme receive a gold card which allows them to access servic\n- es in their health district, and, if necessary, be referred for specialist treatment elsewhere. The bulk of finance comes from public revenues, with funding all\n- ocated to Contracting Units for Primary Care annually on a population basis. According to the WHO, 65% of Thailand\'s health care expenditure in 2004 came from t\n- he government, 35% was from private sources.[38] Although the reforms have received a good deal of critical comment, they have proved popular with poorer Thais,\n- \" especially in rural areas, and survived the change of government after the 2006 military coup. The then Public Health Minister, Mongkol Na Songkhla, abolished \"\n- \"the 30 baht co-payment and made the UC scheme free. It is not yet clear whether the scheme will be modified further under the coalition government that came to \"\n- |-\n power in January 2008.[44][45][46]\n [edit] Europe\n Virtually all of Europe has publicly sponsored and regulated universal health care. The public plans in some co\n- \"untries provide basic or \\\"sick\\\" coverage only; their citizens can purchase supplemental insurance for additional coverage. Countries with universal health care \"\n- include Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, I\n- celand, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal,[47] Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, S\n- |-\n lovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine[48] and the United Kingdom.[49]\n [edit] Austria\n In Austria, public health care (the care, not the running of hospita\n- ls itself) is funded by means of so called \"Social insurance contributions\" accounting for approx. 24% of the salary, they are therefore no taxes as such. 7% of\n- \" the contribution is reserved for health coverage in one of Austria\'s 22 public insurances, but cannot exceed EUR 281,- monthly (USD 399,-). Depending on the jo\"\n- b, somebody will be insured at one of the 9 state-run territorial health funds or at job specific insurances, e.g. public employees or farmers have their own (c\n- ompulsory) health insurance. 22 public insurances for 8 million people is subject to violent criticism, as tremendous savings could be reached by unifying the i\n- nsurances to one centralized provider. However, no Austrian state is willing to give up its own public insurances as it is sphere of action for electoral campai\n- gns. The operation of hospitals is not paid by social contributions, but by taxes. This means that general health coverage adds up to much more and is therefore\n- \" more expensive as often depicted. Austria spends approx. 10% of its GDP for health coverage.\\n\\\n [edit] Finland\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in Finland\\n\\\n In Finland, pub\"\n- lic medical services at clinics and hospitals are run by the municipalities (local government) and are funded 76% by taxation, 20% by patients through access ch\n- arges, and 4% by others. Private provision is mainly in the primary care sector. There are a few private hospitals [50]. The main hospitals are either municipal\n- \"ly owned (funded from local taxes) or run by the medical teaching universities (funded jointly by the municipalities and the national government). According to \"\n- \"a survey published by the European Commission in 2000, Finland\'s is in the top 4 of EU countries in terms of satisfaction with their hospital care system: 88% o\"\n- f Finnish respondents were satisfied compared with the EU average of 41.3%.[51] Finnish health care expenditures are below the European average.[citation needed\n- \"] The private medical sector accounts for about 14 percent of total health care spending. Only 8% of doctors choose to work in private practice, and some of the\"\n- |-\n se also choose to do some work in the public sector.[citation needed]\n Taxation funding is partly local and partly nationally based. The national social insuranc\n- e institution KELA reimburses part of patients prescription costs and makes a contribution towards private medical costs (including dentistry) if they choose to\n- \" be treated in the private sector rather than the public sector. Patient access charges are subject to annual caps. For example GP visits cost \\xE2\\x82\\xAC11 per visit w\"\n- \"ith annual \\xE2\\x82\\xAC33 cap; hospital outpatient treatment \\xE2\\x82\\xAC22 per visit; a hospital stay, including food, medical care and medicines \\xE2\\x82\\xAC26 per 24 hours, or \\xE2\\x82\\xAC12 if\"\n- \" in a psychiatric hospital. After a patient has spent \\xE2\\x82\\xAC590 per year on public medical services (including prescription drugs), all treatment and medications t\"\n- |-\n hereafter in that year are free.\n [edit] Germany\n Main article: Health care in Germany\n Germany has the world\'s oldest universal health care system, with origins d\n- \"ating back to Otto von Bismarck\'s Health Insurance Act of 1883.[52] As mandatory health insurance, it originally applied only to low-income workers and certain \"\n- government employees, but has gradually expanded to cover the great majority of the population.[53] The system is decentralized with private practice physicians\n- \" providing ambulatory care, and independent, mostly non-profit hospitals providing the majority of inpatient care. Approximately 92% of the population is covere\"\n- d by a \'Statutory Health Insurance\' plan, which provides a standardized level of coverage through any one of approximately 1100 public or private sickness funds\n- . Standard insurance is funded by a combination of employee contributions, employer contributions and government subsidies on a scale determined by income level\n- . Higher income workers sometimes choose to pay a tax and opt out of the standard plan, in favor of \'private\' insurance. The latter\'s premiums are not linked to\n- \" income level but instead to health status.[54]\\n\\\n Historically, the level of provider reimbursement for specific services is determined through negotiations betwe\"\n- \"en regional physician\'s associations and sickness funds. Since 1976 the government has convened an annual commission, comprised of representatives of business, \"\n- labor, physicians, hospitals, and insurance and pharmaceutical industries.[55] The commission takes into account government policies and makes recommendations t\n- \"o regional associations with respect to overall expenditure targets. In 1986 expenditure caps were implemented and were tied to the age of the local population \"\n- as well as the overall wage increases. Although reimbursement of providers is on a fee-for-service basis the amount to be reimbursed for each service is determi\n- ned retrospectively to ensure that spending targets are not exceeded. Capitated care, such as that provided by U.S. health maintenance organizations, has been c\n- onsidered as a cost containment mechanism but would require consent of regional medical associations, and has not materialized.[56] Copayments were introduced i\n- n the 1980s in an attempt to prevent overutilization and control costs. The average length of hospital stay in Germany has decreased in recent years from 14 day\n- s to 9 days, still considerably longer than average stays in the U.S. (5 to 6 days).[57][58] The difference is partly driven by the fact that hospital reimburse\n- ment is chiefly a function of the number of hospital days as opposed to procedures or the patient\'s diagnosis. Drug costs have increased substantially, rising n\n- \"early 60% from 1991 through 2005. Despite attempts to contain costs, overall health care expenditures rose to 10.7% of GDP in 2005, comparable to other western \"\n- |-\n European nations, but substantially less than that spent in the U.S. (nearly 16% of GDP).[59]\n [edit] Ireland\n Main article: Health care in Ireland\n The public hea\n- \"lth care system of the Republic of Ireland is governed by the Health Act 2004, which established a new body to be responsible for providing health and personal \"\n- social services to everyone living in Ireland - the Health Service Executive. The new national health service came into being officially on 1 January 2005; howe\n- ver the new structures are currently in the process of being established as the reform programme continues. In addition to the public-sector, there is also a la\n- |-\n rge private healthcare market.\n [edit] Netherlands\n Main article: Health care in the Netherlands\n The Netherlands has a dual-level system. All primary and curative\n- \" care (i.e. the family doctor service and hospitals and clinics) is financed from private compulsory insurance. Long term care for the elderly, the dying, the l\"\n- ong term mentally ill etc. is covered by social insurance funded from taxation. According to the WHO, the health care system in the Netherlands was 62% governme\n- |-\n nt funded and 38% privately funded as of 2004.[38]\n Insurance companies must offer a core universal insurance package for the universal primary, curative care wh\n- ich includes the cost of all prescription medicines. They must do this at a fixed price for all. The same premium is paid whether young or old, healthy or sick.\n- \" It is illegal in The Netherlands for insurers to refuse an application for health insurance, to impose special conditions (e.g. exclusions, deductibles, co-pay\"\n- \"s etc or refuse to fund treatments which a doctor has determined to be medically necessary). The system is 50% financed from payroll taxes paid by employers to \"\n- \"a fund controlled by the Health regulator. The government contributes an additional 5% to the regulator\'s fund. The remaining 45% is collected as premiums paid \"\n- by the insured directly to the insurance company. Some employers negotiate bulk deals with health insurers and some even pay the employees\' premiums as an emplo\n- yment benefit). All insurance companies receive additional funding from the regulator\'s fund. The regulator has sight of the claims made by policyholders and th\n- \"erefore can redistribute the funds its holds on the basis of relative claims made by policy holders. Thus insurers with high payouts will receive more from the \"\n- regulator than those with low payouts. Thus insurance companies have no incentive to deter high cost individuals from taking insurance and are compensated if th\n- ey have to pay out more than might be expected. Insurance companies compete with each other on price for the 45% direct premium part of the funding and try to n\n- \"egotiate deals with hospitals to keep costs low and quality high. The competition regulator is charged with checking for abuse of dominant market positions and \"\n- the creation of cartels that act against the consumer interests. An insurance regulator ensures that all basic policies have identical coverage rules so that no\n- \" person is medically disadvantaged by his or her choice of insurer.\\n\\\n Hospitals in the Netherlands are also regulated and inspected but are mostly privately run a\"\n- nd for profit, as are many of the insurance companies. Patients can choose where they want to be treated and have access to information on the internet about th\n- e performance and waiting times at each hospital. Patients dissatisfied with their insurer and choice of hospital can cancel at any time but must make a new agr\n- |-\n eement with another insurer.\n Insurance companies can offer additional services at extra cost over and above the universal system laid down by the regulator, e.g\n- \". for dental care. The standard monthly premium for health care paid by individual adults is about \\xE2\\x82\\xAC100 per month. Persons on low incomes can get assistance f\"\n- rom the government if they cannot afford these payments. Children under 18 are insured by the system at no additional cost to them or their families because the\n- \" insurance company receives the cost of this from the regulator\'s fund.\\n\\\n [edit] United Kingdom\\n\\\n Main article: Healthcare in the United Kingdom\\n\\\n Each of the Countri\"\n- \"es of the United Kingdom has a National Health Service that provides public healthcare to all UK permanent residents that is free at the point of need and paid \"\n- for from general taxation. However, since Health is a devolved matter, considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries.[60]\n- |-\n \n [edit] England\n Main article: Healthcare in England\n The National Health Service (NHS), created by the National Health Service Act 1946 has provided the majority\n- \" of healthcare in England since its launch on 5 July 1948.\\n\\\n The NHS Constitution for England documents at high level, the objectives of the NHS, the legal rights\"\n- \" and responsibilities of the various parties (patients, staff, NHS trust boards) and the guiding principles which govern the service.[61] The NHS constitution m\"\n- \"akes it clear that it provides a comprehensive service, available to all irrespective of age, gender, disability, race, sexual orientation, religion or belief; \"\n- \"that access to NHS services is based on clinical need and not an individual\\xE2\\x80\\x99s ability to pay; and that care is never refused on unreasonable grounds. Patient \"\n- choice in terms of doctor, care, treatments and place of treatment is an important aspect of the NHS\'s ambition, and in some cases patients can elect for treatm\n- ent in other European countries at the NHS\'s expense. Wait times are low, with most people able to see their primary care doctor on the same day or the followin\n- g day[62] and only 36.1% of hospital admissions are from a waiting list, with the remainder being either emergencies admitted immediately or else pre-booked adm\n- issions or similar (e.g. child birth) [63]. No patient should experience a delay of more than 18 weeks from initial hospital referral to final treatment[64]. Th\n- |-\n is includes the time for all investigative tests and consultations, and two thirds of patients are currently treated in under 12 weeks.[65]\n Although centrally f\n- \"unded there is no large central bureaucracy to manage it. Responsibility is highly devolved to geographical areas through Strategic Health Authorities and even \"\n- more locally through NHS primary care trusts , NHS hospital trusts and increasingly to NHS foundation trusts which are providing even more decentralized service\n- s within the NHS framework, with more decision making taken by local people, patients and staff. The central government office, the Department of Health, is not\n- \" involved in day to day decision making in either the Strategic Health Authorities or the individual local trusts (primarily health, hospital or ambulance) or t\"\n- he national specialist trusts such as NHS Blood and Transplant, but it does lay down general guidelines for them to follow. Local trusts are accountable to thei\n- |-\n r local populations, whilst government ministers are accountable to Parliament for the service overall.\n The NHS provides, among other things, primary care, in-p\n- \"atient care, long-term healthcare, psychiatric care and treatments ophthalmology and dentistry. All treatment is free with the exception of certain charges for \"\n- prescriptions, dentistry and ophthalmology (which themselves are free to children, the elderly, the unemployed and those on low incomes). Eighty-nine percent of\n- \" NHS prescriptions are obtained free of charge, mosly children, pensioners and pregnat women. Others pay a flat rate of \\xC2\\xA37.20[66], and others may cap their ann\"\n- ual charges. Private health care has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance. Private insurance accounts for only 4 percent of heal\n- th expenditure and covers little more than a tenth of the population. [67]. Private insurers in the UK only cover acute care from specialists. They do not cover\n- \" generalist consultations, pre-existing conditions, medical emergencies, organ transplants, chronic conditions such as diabetes or conditions such as pregnancy \"\n- or HIV. [68] Most NHS general practitioners are private doctors who contract to provide NHS services but most hospitals are publicly owned and run through NHS T\n- rusts. A few NHS medical services such as \"surgicentres\") are sub-contracted to private providers [69] as are some non-medical services (such as catering). Some\n- \" capital projects such as new hospitals have been funded through the Private Finance Initiative, enabling investment without excessive strain on the public sect\"\n- |-\n or borrowing requirement.\n [edit] Northern Ireland\n Main article: Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland\n Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland is the des\n- |-\n ignation of the national public health service in Northern Ireland.\n [edit] Scotland\n Main article: Healthcare in Scotland\n NHS Scotland, created by the National H\n- ealth Service (Scotland) Act 1947, was also launched on 5 July 1948 though it has always been a separate organisation. Since devolution, NHS Scotland follows th\n- |-\n e policies and priorities of the Scottish Government, including the phasing out of all prescription charges by 2011.\n [edit] Wales\n Main article: Healthcare in Wa\n- |-\n les\n NHS Wales was originally formed as part of the same NHS structure created by the National Health Service Act 1946 but powers over the NHS in Wales came unde\n- |-\n r the Secretary of State for Wales in 1969[70], in turn being transferred under devolution to what is now the Welsh Assembly Government.\n [edit] Oceania\n [edit] A\n- \"ustralia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n Medicare\'s logo\\n\\n\\n\\\n Main article: Medicare (Australia)\\n\\\n In Australia, Medibank \\xE2\\x80\\x94 as it was then known \\xE2\\x80\\x94 was introduced, by the Whitlam Labor gover\"\n- nment on 1 July 1975, through the Health Insurance Act 1973. The Australian Senate rejected the changes multiple times and they were passed only after a joint s\n- itting after the 1974 double dissolution election. However, Medibank was supported by the subsequent Fraser Coalition (Australia) government and became a key fe\n- \"ature of Australia\\xE2\\x80\\x99s public policy landscape. The exact structure of Medibank/Medicare, in terms of the size of the rebate to doctors and hospitals and the wa\"\n- y it has administered, has varied over the years. The original Medibank program proposed a 1.35% levy (with low income exemptions) but these bills were rejected\n- \" by the Senate, and so Medibank was funded from general taxation. In 1976, the Fraser Government introduced a 2.5% levy and split Medibank in two: a universal s\"\n- |-\n cheme called Medibank Public and a government-owned private health insurance company, Medibank Private.\n During the 1980s, Medibank Public was renamed Medicare b\n- y the Hawke Labor government, which also changed the funding model, to an income tax surcharge, known as the Medicare Levy, which was set at 1.5%, with exemptio\n- ns for low income earners.[71] The Howard Coalition government introduced an additional levy of 1.0%, known as the Medicare Levy Surcharge, for those on high an\n- nual incomes ($70,000) and do not have adequate levels of private hospital coverage.[72] This was part of an effort by the Coalition to encourage take-up of pri\n- vate health insurance. According to WHO, government funding covered 67.5% of Australia\'s health care expenditures in 2004; private sources covered the remaining\n- \" 32.5% of expenditures.[38]\\n\\\n [edit] New Zealand\\n\\\n Main article: Health care in New Zealand\\n\\\n As with Australia, New Zealand\'s healthcare system is funded through gen\"\n- eral taxation. According to the WHO, government sources covered 77.4% of New Zealand\'s health care costs in 2004; private expenditures covered the remaining 22.\n- |-\n 6%.[38]\n [edit] Economics\n Main article: Health care economics\n [edit] Funding models\n Universal health care in most countries has been achieved by a mixed model of\n- \" funding. General taxation revenue is the primary source of funding, but in many countries it is supplemented by specific levies (which may be charged to the in\"\n- dividual and/or an employer) or with the option of private payments (either direct or via optional insurance) for services beyond that covered by the public sys\n- |-\n tem.\n Almost all European systems are financed through a mix of public and private contributions.[73] The majority of universal health care systems are funded pr\n- imarily by tax revenue (e.g. Portugal[73] and Spain). Some nations, such as Germany, France[49] and Japan[74] employ a multi-payer system in which health care i\n- s funded by private and public contributions. However, much of the non-government funding is by defined contributions by employers and employees to regulated no\n- |-\n n-profit sickness funds. These contributions are compulsory and vary according to a person\'s salary, and are effectively a form of hypothecated taxation.\n A dist\n- inction is also made between municipal and national healthcare funding. For example, one model is that the bulk of the healthcare is funded by the municipality,\n- \" speciality healthcare is provided and possibly funded by a larger entity, such as a municipal co-operation board or the state, and the medications are paid by \"\n- |-\n a state agency.\n Universal health care systems are modestly redistributive. Progressivity of health care financing has limited implications for overall income in\n- |-\n equality.[75]\n [edit] Single-payer\n Main article: Single-payer health care\n The term single-payer health care is used in the United States to describe a funding me\n- chanism meeting the costs of medical care from a single fund. Although the fund holder is usually the government, some forms of single-payer employ a public-pri\n- |-\n vate system.\n [edit] Public\n Some countries (notably the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain) have eliminated insurance entirely and choose to fund health care direct\n- ly from taxation. Other countries with insurance-based systems effectively meet the cost of insuring those unable to insure themselves via social security arran\n- |\n gements funded from taxation, either by directly paying their medical bills or by paying for insurance premiums for those affected.\n [edit] Compulsory insurance\n\n- This is usually enforced via legislation requiring residents to purchase insurance, though sometimes, in effect, the government provides the insurance. Sometime\n- s there may be a choice of multiple public and private funds providing a standard service (e.g. as in Germany) or sometimes just a single public fund (as in Can\n- |-\n ada).\n In some European countries where there is private insurance and universal health care, such as Germany, Belgium, and The Netherlands, the problem of adver\n- se selection (see Private insurance below) is overcome using a risk compensation pool to equalize, as far as possible, the risks between funds. Thus a fund with\n- \" a predominantly healthy, younger population has to pay into a compensation pool and a fund with an older and predominantly less healthy population would receiv\"\n- e funds from the pool. In this way, sickness funds compete on price and there is no advantage to eliminate people with higher risks because they are compensated\n- \" for by means of risk-adjusted capitation payments. Funds are not allowed to pick and choose their policyholders or deny coverage, but then mainly compete on pr\"\n- |-\n ice and service. In some countries the basic coverage level is set by the government and cannot be modified.[76]\n Ireland at one time had a \"community rating\" sy\n- \"stem through VHI, effectively a single-payer or common risk pool. The government later opened VHI to competition but without a compensation pool. This resulted \"\n- in foreign insurance companies entering the Irish market and offering cheap health insurance to relatively healthy segments of the market which then made higher\n- \" profits at VHI\'s expense. The government later re-introduced community rating through a pooling arrangement and at least one main major insurance company, BUPA\"\n- \", then withdrew from the Irish market.\\n\\\n [edit] Private insurance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\n This article may be inaccurate in or unbalanced towards certain viewpoints.

(June 2009)\n \n \n In some countries with universal coverage, priva\n- te insurance often excludes many health conditions which are expensive and which the state health care system can provide.

(\\xE2\\x80\\xA0 indicates that treatment may be provided in certain circumstances)\\n\\\n Where voluntary insurance (often private) is predominant,\"\n- \" such as in the U.S., medical (health) insurance is subject to the well-known economic problem of adverse selection which may also be referred to as a market fa\"\n- ilure.[citation needed] Adverse selection in insurance markets occurs because those providing insurance have limited information with which to estimate the heal\n- th risks on which they may need to pay future claims.[citation needed] In simple terms, those with poor health are more likely to apply for insurance and more l\n- ikely to need treatments requiring high insurance company payouts.[citation needed] Those with good health may find the cost of insurance too high for the perce\n- ived benefit, and some will remove themselves from the risk pool.[citation needed] This adverse selection concentrates the risk pool, thereby further raising co\n- sts.[citation needed] In practical terms, the potential for adverse selection means that private insurers have an economic incentive to use medical underwriting\n- \" to \'weed out\' high cost applicants in order to avoid adverse selection.[citation needed] Among the potential solutions posited by economists are single payer s\"\n- ystems as well as other methods of ensuring that health insurance is universal, such as by requiring all citizens to purchase insurance and limiting the ability\n- \" of insurance companies to deny insurance to individuals or vary price between individuals.[78][79]\\n\\n\\\n [edit] See also\\n\\n\\\n Health care compared - tabular comparisons\"\n- \" of the US, Canada, and other countries not shown above.\\n\\\n Health care reform debate in the United States\\n\\\n Health insurance cooperative\\n\\\n Millennium Development Goal\"\n- |-\n s\n National health insurance\n Publicly-funded health care\n Single-payer health care\n \n [edit] References\n \n \n ^ a b Insuring America\'s Health: Principles and Recommenda\n- |-\n tions, Institute of Medicine at the National Academies of Science, 2004-01-14\n ^ \"Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Questions and Answers\" (PDF).
