== Wikicell

Wikicell is a text-message based (SMS) interface for Wikipedia, using FrontlineSMS and Ruby on Rails. 

Connect Frontline to a mobile phone and point it at the Rails mysql database, and you can text the mobile phone to query Wikipedia. Any word you text will be searched for in Wikipedia and the best matching article will be texted back in ~160 character chunks. To read the next chunk, you can text back 'next'.

You'll need the httparty gem, which you can install by running rake gems:install.

I hereby release this code under the MIT License. I'd love to hear how you use it; link back and/or email jeff@unterbahn.com.

Enjoy!

* convert to txtspeak for space savings
* don't parse whole article - just the part we're sending
